Running marketing campaigns can be expensive, something that most small business owners cannot afford. However, you can still run a successful campaign on a budget using cheap branded items. Branded keyrings reign supreme in the promotional merchandise world.

They are cheap to make, practical, and offer a platform to market your brand. You also get the opportunity to explore your creative side while building something your customers love. However, the real problem lies in finding the perfect people to help you in the design and manufacturing phases.

Here are tips to help you craft impressive rubber keyrings that will boost your brand’s authority and earn more customers.

## Why Choose Rubber?

You might be thinking, why use rubber instead of metal or wood to carve branded keyrings? Well, rubber is cheaper than both other options. There are also more printing options you can try with rubber that you can’t with metal or wood.

Rubber is durable and can withstand wear and tear before the ink starts chipping off. You also don’t have to worry about your phone getting scratched, unlike if you are carrying a keyring with a metallic handle.

Also worth mentioning is the versatility rubber offers for intricate designs. It can be molded into 3D designs or shapes. You can add details to the final design using colors, 3D effects, and textures.

## Let’s Talk Design

Designing branded merchandise can be challenging. You can use a simple design featuring your logo, business name, and brand colors. However, this can go under the radar, defeating the overall purpose of [making branded rubber keyrings](https://rocketbadge.co.uk/keyrings/rubber-keyrings/).

First, take your time and learn more about your target audience. Your goal is to craft a design that your customers can resonate with. For example, you can add a compass to the keyrings if most of your customers are outdoor enthusiasts.

Next, ensure that the design complements your brand identity. Instead of designing using regular shapes, why not carve the rubber to match your logo’s shape? Last, consider the size and weight. Ensure that the final product offers the perfect balance between aesthetics and practicality.

## Working With a Manufacturer

With everything ready, it is time to find a rubber keyrings manufacturer. Look for a reputable manufacturer with experience building branded items. Do some background checks on the products and brands they have worked with.

Once you have a shortlist, ask for quotes and compare their prices. Your decision shouldn’t be based on money alone. Compare the services provided by each manufacturer. For example, you will be better off paying more if the manufacturer offers in-house design services.

Review the contract details before signing the deal. Ensure that the delivery timelines are in line with your marketing campaign.

## Putting Your Rubber Keyrings to Work

The last step is putting your branded rubber keyrings to work. Think about how you will distribute the keyrings to your target audience. You can set up a stand at your local trade show and hand the keyrings to those who visit your stand.

Also, you can run competitions on social media and offer them as rewards to the winners. You can boost your revenue by making limited-edition rubber keyrings and putting them up for sale.
