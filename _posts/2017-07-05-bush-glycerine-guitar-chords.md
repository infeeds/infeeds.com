INTRO

F . C . Dm . Bb x2

VERSE

F                 C               Dm
 It must be your skin I'm sinking in
                Bb                    F      
 It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
              C
And I didn't mind
             Dm
It's not my kind
             Bb              F
It's not my time to wonder why
                    C
Everything's gone white
                   Dm
And everything's gray
            Bb                F
Now you're here now you're away
               C
I don't want this
           Dm
Remember that
              Bb                F  C
I'll never forget where you're at

CHORUS

              Dm       Bb
Don't let the days go by
      F   C  Bb
Glycerine
      F   C  Bb
Glycerine

VERSE

F            C
 I'm never alone
                  Dm
I'm alone all the time
           Bb              F
Are you at one or do you lie?
              C
We live in a wheel
                Dm
Where everyone steals
             Bb                        F
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields
                  C
If I treated you bad
                Dm
You bruised my face
                   Bb
Couldn't love you more
                    F      C
You got a beautiful taste

CHORUS

               Dm       Bb
 Don't let the days go by
F                C         Dm
 Could have been easier on you
            Bb                     F
I couldn't change though I wanted to
                 C           Dm
Should have been easier by three
                Bb               F   C  Bb
Our old friend fear and you and me
      F    C  Bb
Glycerine

BRIDGE

Dm            Bb
 Black moon white again
Dm            Bb 
 Black moon white again
          Bb
 And she falls around me

VERSE

F              C
 I needed you more
                  Dm
When we wanted us less
             Bb           F
I could not kiss just regress
              C
It might just be
                    Dm
Clear simple and plain
                   Bb
Well, that's just fine
                       F    C
That's just one of my names

 Don't let the days go by
F              C          Dm        Bb
 Could've been easier on you, you, you
      F   C  Bb

      F   C  Bb
