Are you considering family care facilities for a parent or loved one but don’t know where to start? Are you overwhelmed by the multitude of options available today?

LTC, or long-term care facilities, can be an excellent place for someone who needs a lot of supervision. They also provide support to get well after an illness or surgery.

If you or your loved one need to enter an LTC facility because of an injury or severe illness, choose the best one for your needs. How do you do that?

This article will help you identify what to consider when choosing long-term care facilities to get the best care. Read on!

## **1. Research and Visit Multiple Facilities**

Researching different facilities will help you narrow down your options. LTCs usually have a website where you can read information about their facilities. You can google “long-term care facilities” or [find adult family care here](https://adultfamilyhomecouncil.org/long-term-care/auburn-wa/).

You can also check out online reviews from former residents and family members. This will give you an idea of the quality of care they provide.

Visit each facility and ask as many questions as possible about their services and policies. Prioritize your needs and expectations of the facility and compile questions specific to them.

Compare the amenities each facility offers to find the best fit for your needs. Spend time at each facility, speak with the staff, and get to know the residents to understand the environment. By taking the time to research and visit multiple long-term care facilities properly, you might be able to find the best fit for you or your loved one’s needs.

## **2. Evaluate Staffing and Quality of Care**

Evaluate the quality of staffing, especially the ratio of staff to residents. Ideally, this ratio should not be too high, as this could lead to reduced quality of care.

Additionally, you should inquire about the facilitys staff turnover rate. Inquire about the experience and qualifications of the staff you are likely to come into contact with.

Ask about the staff’s training and qualifications, how medical crises are handled, and how medications are given. It is also wise to inquire about additional measures the facility may have to ensure the quality of care, such as auditing programs and quality improvement teams.

## **3. Consider Location and Accessibility**

Family members and friends need to be able to visit easily. Accessibility to public transportation is another benefit for visitors and care recipients.

Also, if the facility is close to medical resources such as hospitals and pharmacies, that can make care easier to manage. Additionally, if the facility is near recreational opportunities that their loved ones can still enjoy, this is also a plus.

Consider local weather conditions for elderly residents, including hot and cold conditions for both summer and winter. Lastly, proximity to family and friends may be a priority for some when choosing a facility. Remember these factors and balance them to decide on the best long-term care facility for your loved one.

## **4. Assess Safety and Security Measures**

Safety and security measures are integral to any long-term care facility. It is essential to ensure that your loved one is secure and protected from physical harm or theft.

Ask the facility about specific security protocols to assess safety and security measures. Additionally, safety features like handrails, grab bars, and wheelchair accessibility ensure a safe living environment, especially for adult family care.

Additionally, research any recent incidents or facility violations and ask the staff about the measures they have taken to address any problems. Take the time to visit the facility and observe the environment for signs of secure or insecure areas.

## **5. Consider Amenities and Activities**

When considering long-term care facilities, amenities and activities are a great place to start. Look for services offered such as:

- transportation
- laundry
- housekeeping
- religious services and worship
- health and wellness
- assisted living services
- recreational activities
- therapy programs

Review activity calendars to get an idea of the activities offered. Ask questions about the types of activities residents participate in and look for opportunities for residents to stay engaged in hobbies and everyday activities.

You can ask questions like, “Are there social and recreational opportunities available?” or “Does the facility offer academic programs, volunteering/community involvement, and fitness and wellness programs?”

Ask how much autonomy residents have to choose what activities they want to participate in and if there are any restrictions. People need options to make the best of their situation and help them stay engaged, energized, and social.

## **6. Check Licensing and Accreditation**

Considering that health professionals operate family care facilities, reviewing their licensing data and accreditation information is crucial. Licensing ensures the facility meets basic quality standards. Meanwhile, accreditation indicates that the facility adheres to higher quality standards of service and care.

You’ll want to ensure the facility is certified by the relevant government bodies, such as the:

- Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
- Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO)
- Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)

Proper licensing and accreditation of the facility will provide assurance that the facility is up to code and operating within the standards of care and safety. It will also give you peace of mind that the facility is reputable with strong caregiving and medical staff.

## **7. Consider the Cost and Financial Considerations**

When choosing a long-term care facility, cost and financial considerations are important. Begin by getting a good sense of the financial obligations required for admission.

Ask what services are included in the cost and what is not included. Identifying any additional fees associated with specific services is also essential. Make sure you understand how health insurance and Medicaid will cover fees.

Carefully evaluate all financial assistance options, as certain services will be included in the insurance coverage. Consider whether the facility offers [sliding scale payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sliding-scale.asp#:~:text=Sliding%20scale%20fees%20are%20fees,the%20less%20you%20will%20pay.), which can make adult family care more affordable. Speak with a financial advisor and explore your options to ensure the facility is cost-effective and will meet your budget.

## **Finding the Right Long-Term Care Facilities**

Choosing long-term care facilities for you or your loved one is a complex decision that requires research and consideration. These tips will guide you in navigating this process, including researching facilities, exploring payment options, and ensuring the right fit for the individual.

Most importantly, don’t rush the decision take the time to review available options. Contact facilities if you need additional assistance.
