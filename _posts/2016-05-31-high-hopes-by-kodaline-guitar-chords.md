- I'm playing with Capo

VERSE
```
`C        G              Am`

```
Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
```

`F           C                E              Am      G    F`

```
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
```

```
C          E         Am      G
```

```
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
```

`F                    G`

```
But it's not that easy
```

`C               G                 Am`

```
I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
```

`F               C              E               Am  G        F`

```
But I've only got myself to blame for it, and I accept it now
```

```
C      E              Am      G      F
```

```
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
```

```
G
```

```
But it's not that easy
```

```
CHORUS
```

```
F      C        G                 Am      G
```

```
But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
```

`F      C             E               Am      G       F`

```
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
```

`F    C      E        Am      G        F`

```
High hopes, when it all comes to an end
```

```
G        C
```

```
But the world keeps spinning around

```
Am . G . F . G
```

```
VERSE
```

```
C            G                 Am
```

```
And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts of all the people who have come and gone
```

`F        C                    E                     Am        G        F`

```
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
```

`F     C             E             Am     G    F`

```
Na√Øve I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
```

`F            G`

```
And I do believe that, yeah
```

```
