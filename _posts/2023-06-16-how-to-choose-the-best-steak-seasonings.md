A good piece of meat is never going to fail you. But great meat depends on you.

If you have good quality protein, great steak seasonings can elevate the dish to the exceptional. But without those seasonings, your meal falls flat.

Before you put your hand on the seasonings, you need to know which is best to put your hand on. Keep reading to learn how to choose the best steak seasonings.

## **Identify Your Preferred Flavor Profile**

When choosing a steak seasoning, it is important to identify your preferred flavor profile. To do this, consider what tastes you like. For example, when you prepare a [delicious steak box meal](https://goldensteersteakcompany.com/blogs/journal/5-ways-to-prepare-a-delicious-steak-box-meal-for-a-luxury-dinner), do you prefer salty, savory, spicy, or sweet?

If you like something savory, you might choose a seasoning with minced garlic, ground pepper, and smoked paprika. For a sweet flavor, try a blend with honey, brown sugar, and pepper.

If you like something spicy, you might opt for a seasoning mix that includes chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes. Salt is also an essential component of any steak seasoning.

Consider a mix with kosher or sea salt for a robust flavor. Finally, you may choose an “all-in-one” seasoning like Montreal Steak. Once you identify your preferred flavor profile, it’s easier to pick the right steak seasoning for the perfect meal.

## **Consider the Cut and Cooking Method of the Steak**

When it comes to choosing the right steak seasoning, it is important to consider the cut and [cooking method of the steak](https://www.mychicagosteak.com/steak-university/best-steak-cooking-methods-ranked). Different cuts of steak have their own unique flavor and texture.

Using the wrong seasoning can take away from those flavors and create a dish that is less than desirable. If you are grilling a rib eye or filet mignon, look for robust steak seasonings like garlic, smoked paprika, and thyme.

These flavors will stand up to the steak’s natural flavor. For thinner cuts, like flank or flat iron steak, go with gentle seasonings like rosemary and lemon pepper to create a light and refreshing dish.

Finally, if you are cooking a steak in a pan or oven, use moderate seasonings like Italian herbs, zesty citrus, and, of course, salt and pepper. Choosing the best steak seasonings is essential to creating a delicious steak dish.

## **Pair With Other Ingredients for Maximum Taste**

When it comes to flavoring the perfect steak, the best seasoning combination to pair with other ingredients for maximum taste is black pepper and sea salt. Other seasonings, such as garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, curry powder, and paprika, can be added to enhance the overall flavor.

When combining these spices, you will want to start from the least amount first and gradually increase in order to achieve the desired flavor. It is also important to match the seasoning with the type of steak being used.

For example, an Italian steak might taste better with herbs like oregano, basil, and thyme added in. Whatever the combination, always test the seasoning on a small piece of steak before applying it to the entire dish.
