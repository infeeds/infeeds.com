Liverpool and Manchester City are set to face off at Anfield this Sunday in what could be a title-defining match for Arsenal's championship hopes. Arne Slot's side has finally found their attacking rhythm after a frustrating run of draws, while Pep Guardiola's team continues to stumble in their pursuit of a seventh league crown.

The Reds put six past Qarabag in the Champions League before dismantling Newcastle 4-1 last weekend. Hugo Ekitike has been on fire, reaching 10 goals for the season with a brace against the Magpies. City, on the other hand, threw away a two-goal lead against Spurs before bouncing back with a 3-1 victory over Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semifinals.

Kickoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. GMT on Sunday, February 8th. For viewers in North America, that translates to 11:30 a.m. ET or 8:30 a.m. PT. Australians will need to set their alarms for 3:30 a.m. AEDT on Monday morning.

## Streaming Options in the United States

If you're in the US, Peacock has exclusive rights to this match. You'll need either a Premium subscription at $11 monthly or Premium Plus at $17 monthly to catch the action. The price increases are still fresh, and honestly, it's getting harder to justify yet another streaming subscription just to watch football. But if you're following the Premier League closely, there's no way around it.

The [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) behind streaming has made watching football more accessible than ever, though it's also created this fragmented landscape where you need multiple subscriptions to follow your team throughout the season.

## Watching from the UK

Sky Sports holds the broadcasting rights in the UK, specifically on the Sky Sports Main Event channel. Existing Sky Sports subscribers can use the Sky Go app to stream on their devices. If you've cut the cord, Now offers a standalone option with day passes at £15 or monthly memberships starting at £35.

The pricing structure for [streaming services](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) has become increasingly complex, and UK viewers are stuck with some of the highest costs for sports content in the world. It's frustrating when you just want to watch your team play without breaking the bank.

## Canadian Viewers Need Fubo

Fubo has locked down exclusive rights to all 380 Premier League matches in Canada. The service is currently offering an introductory rate of CA$27 for the first month before jumping to CA$31.50 monthly. At least Canadians have a one-stop shop instead of juggling multiple platforms.

## Australian Streaming Details

Stan Sport is your only option in Australia, showing every single Premier League match this season. You'll need both a Stan subscription (starting at AU$12) and the Stan Sport add-on at AU$20 monthly. The seven-day free trial is worth grabbing if you're new to the platform, though you'll want to set a reminder to cancel if you're only interested in specific matches.

The service also includes Champions League, Europa League, international rugby, and Formula E, which adds some value beyond just the Premier League.

## The VPN Question

The article mentions VPNs for travelers wanting to access their home streaming services abroad. ExpressVPN gets a shout-out at $3.49 monthly on a two-year plan, though the usual caveats apply about checking terms of service and compliance with streaming platform policies.

Most major streaming services actively block VPN traffic now, so your mileage may vary. The 30-day money-back guarantee gives you some room to test whether it actually works for your needs before committing long-term.

This match could reshape the title race, with Arsenal desperately hoping Liverpool can do them a favor and hand City another setback in what's been their most vulnerable season under Guardiola in years.
