Album : Kids in Love
Year : 2017

Tuning : STANDARD [EADGBe]

VERSE

             Am
Sitting at a bar with some friends
                 F
Telling them the things that you said
                C                 G
Left me with my heart in the hands
                Am
Told me we'd be better just friends
             F
Staring at a television
                    C                G
Something 'bout the world's gonna end

Semi-Chorus

           Am      F   C  G
I think about you, oh
              Am        F   C  G
You think about me too, oh

CHORUS

Am                   F
 If we're losing our minds
                    C    G
 I'll get lost with you
Am                   F
 If we're all gonna die
                  C   G
 I wanna die with you

Am    F
 Ooh, Ooh
                  C   G
 I wanna die with you
Am    F
 Ooh, Ooh
                 C   G
I wanna die with you

VERSE

              Am
I been seeing tears all morning
              F
Feel like my apartment's flooding
             C                    G
I don't even know where we left it
             Am
Maybe I just need to take a shower
                F
Washing off the last ten hours
               C                           G
All I smell is coffee and cigarettes and you

Semi-Chorus

           Am      F   C  G
I think about you, oh
              Am        F   C  G
You think about me too, oh

CHORUS

Am                   F
 If we're losing our minds
                    C    G
 I'll get lost with you
Am                   F
 If we're all gonna die
                  C   G
 I wanna die with you

Am    F
 Ooh, Ooh
                  C   G
 I wanna die with you
Am    F
 Ooh, Ooh
                 C   G
I wanna die with you

Repeat the process, yo.

End.
