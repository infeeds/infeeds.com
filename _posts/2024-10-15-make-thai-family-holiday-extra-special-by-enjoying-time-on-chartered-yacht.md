As the world seemingly becomes smaller, owing to increased knowledge, increased transport, and the advent of the digital age, there are many different places and ways to enjoy a break together as a family. With so many available options, it is always nice when an idea is found which is away from the norm and offers the opportunity to do something others haven't considered.

While millions head to Thailand for their annual break, now too many of them get to see the true beauty that is available but needs extra effort to see. While the cities and coastal resorts are wonderful, visitors can be missing out. However, those who decide to think outside the box and enter [yacht charter Thailand Phuket](https://nakayachtcharter.com/yachts/)  into their favoured search engine will be provided with memories to last a lifetime.

Phuket is a stunning destination, with amazing culture and a history all its own to enjoy. The many night markets, places of entertainment, beaches, and private coves certainly attract visitors in great numbers. Those who relax and look out across the Andaman Sea maybe don't realise that not too far away there are small islands which include caves and some breathtaking nature. Not too far away are iconic locations such as Phi Phi, and Krabi. Those who charter a yacht will get the opportunity to visit and discover all this while in the hands of an experienced captain and obliging crew.

Spending time out at sea with a stunning climate provides a feeling of freedom, that isn't always possible when staying in a busy resort. The privacy and exclusivity that it provides can be enjoyed fully knowing that special memories are being created.

The best companies that provide yacht charters will have a range of vessels to choose from, all fitted out to provide the highest standards of luxury, with Wi-Fi available for those who need to stay in touch with the outside world.
