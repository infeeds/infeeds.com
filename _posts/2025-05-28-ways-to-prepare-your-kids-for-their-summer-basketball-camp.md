Summer is officially here, and we're definitely excited for it! Just because school doors are closing doesn't mean your kids don't get to learn or stop doing fun activities. Summer vacation is definitely the perfect time to expose your children to different sports that they'll get involved in and be able to master as the years progress. This year, you've decided on enrolling your kids at a [summer basketball camp](https://littleboomersbasketball.com.au/school-holidays-basketball-program/)!

Before you send off with Little Boomers Basketball, here is a shopping list that'll equip your kids with the essentials they need to excel at this holiday camp.

*Sportswear* -- It's always advisable for your kids to wear sensible and comfortable clothing such as a sports shirt and shorts. Buy at least 3-4 outfit pairs and also purchase a bunch of sports underwear, especially for your pre-teen boys who need a little support down there. Plenty of socks are a good idea too. And of course, don't forget jackets or raincoats/winter coats depending on the weather and schedule of the holiday camp.

*Sunscreen* -- Too often people forget to stock up on sunscreen during the summer months, at the cost of reddened burnt skin and irritable teenagers. Don't fall for this mistake by making sure to stock up on bottles of your favourite sunscreen; the higher SPF, the better. At least a fifty SPF against UVA/UVB is the ideal range. Remind your kids to apply and reapply often throughout the day, especially when they indulge in the team huddle, free play, and skills development parts of the basketball camp.

*Footwear* -- This is a non-negotiable when it comes to enrolling your kids in summer camp and especially for a basketball camp. Make sure to buy a sensible pair that's designed for heavy running and jumping around. A good pair of basketball shoes lessens the chance of your kids having a [sports-related injury](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/basketball-preventing-injury) during camp. You should also buy extra cushioned soles just to make sure that your kids' feet will be super comfortable throughout the day.

*Towels and travel toiletries* -- It's important to give your kids the essentials they need to play the game as well as the items they need for aftercare when the game is over at the end of the day. They will definitely need fluffy towels for taking a shower and small towels for wiping down their sweat in between water breaks and in between basketball games. You should also give them a set of toiletries like shampoo or dry shampoo, body wash, body lotion, sunscreen (see above), and plenty of anti-sweat deodorant (if your pre-teens are already using it).

*Sports bag or travel bag* -- It doesn't have to fit camping gear or hockey gear or other equipment-heavy sports. The great thing about a basketball sports camp is that your kids won't need plenty of equipment, just themselves, their drive to learn, and their openness to enjoying the sport. Find a durable backpack or duffel bag that will fit their basketball shoes, their clothes, towels, water bottle, a pack of healthy snacks, some toiletries, and essential gadgets.

You should keep an organised list of these essentials just to make the summer months more convenient for you and your kids. It's important to [stay organised](https://infeeds.com/how-to-stay-organized-through-every-life-changes) in every aspect of your life and your kids' lives so that every experience will be worthwhile!
