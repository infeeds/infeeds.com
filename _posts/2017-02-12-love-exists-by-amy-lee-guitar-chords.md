 It can be born anywhere

 In the last place you'd expect
```

 In a way you'd never dream
```

 A single glance is all it takes

To get inside you

 And it can leave you speechless

 But only one flower

VERSE

 It can tear your world apart or bind to you forever
```

```

 It can grow in darkness, make its own light
```

 Turn a curse into a kiss, change the meaning of your words

 Love makes no sense
```

```

```
So infinitely vast
```

```
Em
 And we're standing on the edge
```

```
G               Bm
 Take my hand, erase the past forever

 I'm drowning in my tears, but my heart's on fire

It can make you better
```

 It can change you slowly
```

 Give you everything you want, ask for nothing in return
```

```
C                    D                  Em
 In the blink of an eye, the hint of a smile
```

 In the way you say goodbye and every time you find me
