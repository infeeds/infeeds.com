 It can be born anywhere

 In the last place you'd expect
```

 In a way you'd never dream
```

 A single glance is all it takes

To get inside you

 But only one flower

VERSE

 It can tear your world apart or bind to you forever
```

```

 It can grow in darkness, make its own light
```

 Turn a curse into a kiss, change the meaning of your words

 Love makes no sense
```

```

```
So infinitely vast
```

```
Em
 And we're standing on the edge
```

```
G               Bm
 Take my hand, erase the past forever

 It can change you slowly

 Give you everything you want, ask for nothing in return
```

```
C                    D                  Em
 In the blink of an eye, the hint of a smile

 In the way you say goodbye and every time you find me
