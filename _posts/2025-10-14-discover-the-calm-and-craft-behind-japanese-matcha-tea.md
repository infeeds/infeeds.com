A peaceful cup of tea might make you feel more grounded right away.  Whisking, pouring, and sipping may slow down even the busiest day.  Australians have fallen in love with [Japanese matcha tea](https://okaeri.au/collections/tea-matcha) in recent years. They enjoy the bright green colour and rich flavour, but they also appreciate how it makes them feel peaceful and like they're doing something special.

## **A Tradition That Goes Back a Long Way**

Matcha is not just any old tea.  It's part of a Japanese tradition that has been around for hundreds of years and values being present and simple.  Matcha is different from steeping leaves and throwing them away. Instead, you whisk finely ground green tea powder right into hot water.  You swallow the whole leaf, which means you get all of its flavour and nutrients.

At OKAERI, we get and prepare each mix of matcha in a way that honours that tradition.  The way the tea is cultivated and ground affects its quality. These are long, deliberate processes that keep the tea's colour and taste.  The drink is smooth and a little earthy, and it seems clean and balanced, much like the ceremony it comes from.

## **Not Just a Drink**

Matcha is special because it can both relax you and give you energy.  It doesn't strike you all at once like coffee does.  L-theanine, an amino acid, slows down the release of caffeine in matcha. This gives you a clear, concentrated form of energy that lasts longer and feels better on the body.

It can also be used in a lot of different ways.  It's just as amazing in lattes, smoothies, or even baked goods as it is when you whisk it into hot water.  You may turn a boring afternoon into a little party with homemade matcha tiramisu or ice cream.  It's also a terrific choice if you want to give someone a [thoughtful gift with a food theme](https://infeeds.com/planning-presents-with-food-theme-keep-pointers) that feels personal, healthy, and well-packaged.

## **Why Australians Love It**

Australia has a long history of loving coffee, but matcha is making a name for itself in the wellness and caf√© scenes. People like how balanced it is; it feels like a treat yet is good for you, and it makes you feel better. It fits nicely with our relaxed way of life, when mornings start slowly and routines are important.

Making matcha has become a little way for many people to be aware. The sound of the bamboo whisk and the way the green powder turns into foam are all ways to slow down and be in the moment. In a world that often praises being busy, those few quiet times might feel like gold.

## **A Better Way to Relax**

[Matcha has several health benefits](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/matcha-a-look-at-possible-health-benefits), including lots of antioxidants, helps with metabolism, and can even help lower stress levels. It is a drink that is good for both the body and the mind.

## **Finding Your Time**

Japanese matcha tea can help you relax, whether you drink it straight or mixed into a creamy latte. The OKAERI range honours the combination of beauty and simplicity by offering high-quality matcha that is easy to drink at home.
