If you are planning a family trip to the great country of Thailand, you have made a very wise choice. This is a country filled with wonderful people and an excellent culture. The food is amazing, the beaches are fantastic, and there is so much to see and do. One of the first things that you need to do to get your holiday off to the best start possible is to book quality accommodation. Get yourself out of the habit of choosing two and three-star establishments, and set your sights a little higher.

For this trip, push the boat out a little and look at **[4 star hotels in Phuket Patong Beach](https://www.novotelphuket.com/)** for the ultimate accommodation experience. It is incredibly likely that you will have an ocean view from your hotel, and you get to enjoy all of the best facilities as well. You may also be surprised to learn that a four-star hotel is a lot more affordable than you might suspect, and to encourage you further, the following are some of the reasons why it needs to be a four-star hotel all the way.

* **Experience the luxury -** It may be only one star up, but moving from a three-star establishment to a four-star one makes a real difference. In many cases, the cost is exactly the same, but you get to [enjoy the highest quality of service](https://infeeds.com/respite-care-explained-how-a-short-break-can-make-a-big-difference), with beds to sleep upon and room service to die for. There won’t be anything that you ask for that won’t be out of reach, and in the unlikely event that they don’t have something that you need, they will endeavour to get it for you.  
* **Experience great sleep -** These four-star establishments spend a great deal of time and money on choosing the right kind of bed and mattress for guests to sleep upon. You have properly heard the expression ‘it was like sleeping on a cloud’, and this is something that you will get to experience here. Many guests are reluctant to leave their room at all, and many just take advantage of the 24-hour room service and live in the lap of luxury.  
* **Experience the many facilities -** When you are on vacation, this is the only time that you really get to pamper yourself. Thankfully, these four-star hotels can offer you things like the ultimate spa experience. You will get to [enjoy the famous Thai massage](https://www.tourismthailand.org/Destinations/Provinces/Phuket/350), get your skin pampered so it is glowing, and there will be a fully fitted out gymnasium, with all of the modern equipment currently available. Your holiday time is supposed to reduce your stress and anxiety levels, so make sure that it actually happens this time.

These are only three of the numerous benefits of staying in a four-star hotel, in any country in the world. Nobody else is going to book such an experience for you; this is something you’re going to have to do for yourself.
