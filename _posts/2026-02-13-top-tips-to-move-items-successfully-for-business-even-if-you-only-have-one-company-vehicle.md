Every business here in Australia needs to move office items, stock and even large pieces of plant and machinery from time to time. It might be that the item is being delivered to a customer, or maybe you are moving everything to different premises. Whatever the reasons, just because you have only one company van, it doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible to make the moves by yourself.

It isn’t difficult to have a tow-bar fitted to your company vehicle, and then you can pretty much pull anything behind it. There is always the option of purchasing [**plant trailers**](https://www.sloanebuilt.com.au/pages/plant-trailer), which can be specifically made to your business’s individual needs. This is something that will prove invaluable when having to move many items at once. This is just one way to move plant/machinery, office equipment and furniture, and anything else in your day-to-day business dealings here in Australia.

The following are some other top ways to make life easier for yourself and your employees when moving anything around.

1. **Always plan ahead –** moving valuable items of plants or other things needs proper planning if everything is to go off without any issues. Start planning the moment you know that something needs to be transported, and [create a checklist of things](https://infeeds.com/how-to-stay-organized-through-every-life-changes/) that need to happen. Every step of the move should be outlined and particular roles given to your staff members.  
2. **Always use quality trailers –** There are many different manufacturers of trailers out there, all across Australia, but they are not all the same. Many don’t pay attention to the smaller details, and you end up with something that is not built professionally. Talk to other business owners about where they bought their trailers and do your due diligence. Don’t be afraid to shop around for a better price, but make sure it is a quality item.  
3. **Plan for the destination –** Whatever it is that you are transporting, be sure to plan for the place that you are going to. You need to know about loading points, whether it is possible to turn both vehicle and trailer, or if you will need to unhitch it. Go see the delivery location, talk to the owner and make proper plans so everything goes as planned, and there are no surprises when you get there.  
4. **Health & safety is paramount –** When working with anything that moves, you need to be aware of your surroundings at all times. Proper communication with whoever is carrying out the move [ensures that everyone is safe](https://business.gov.au/risk-management/health-and-safety/work-health-and-safety) every step of the way. Make sure that the lights on the trailer are operating correctly, so that any vehicle following you knows exactly what you intend to do, before you do it.

Running a business is all about working smarter rather than working harder. This doesn’t mean that you skip over the safety aspects along the way.  A trailer can really make life easier when it comes to transporting anything from here to there, and back again.
