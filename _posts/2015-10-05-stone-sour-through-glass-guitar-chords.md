TUNING :(1/2)Half Step Down [d# A# F# C# G# D#]
```

```
CHORUS :
```

```
C9
I'm looking at you through the glass.
```

```
D
Don't know how much time has passed
```

```
Em
Oh, god it feels like forever
```

```
But no one ever tells you
```

```
D      C9
```

`That forever feels like home`
```
D                            Em
Sitting all alone inside your head
```

`VERSE I :`

```
C9                   D
How do you feel? That is the question
```

                `Em`
`But I forget you don't expect an easy answer`
         `C9                             D`
`When something like a soul becomes initialized`
                                 `Em`
`And folded up like paper dolls and little notes`
                                                D

```
You can't expect a bit of hope

   C9         
So while you're outside looking in
```

```
D
Describing what you see
```

    `Em```
`Remember what you're staring at is me`

```
CHORUS :

                          C9
I'm looking at you through the glass.
                        D
Don't know how much time has passed
            Em
Oh, god it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you
D      C9        
That forever feels like home
D                            Em
Sitting all alone inside your head
```

`VERSE II :`

```
C9                 D
How much is real? So much to question
```

```
Em
An epidemic of the mannequins
```

```
D
Contaminating everything
```

         `C9`
`With thought came from the heart`

```
D
```

```

```

`It never did right from the start`

```
Em    
Just listen to the noises
```

`(Null and void instead of voices)`

```
C9     
Before you tell yourself
```

```
D
It's just a different scene
```

```
Em
Remember it's just different from what you've seen
```

```

```
Sitting all alone inside your head
```
