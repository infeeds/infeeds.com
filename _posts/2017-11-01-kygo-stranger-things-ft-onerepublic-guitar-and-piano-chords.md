 Stranger things
                  Am                            C
 We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
                                 Dm
 We're stranger things (dream of places at)
 'Cause that's just who we are

VERSE

F               G           Am
 We used to run around this ghost town
                 C
 Always thinking out loud
              Dm
 Are we gonna get out
 I remember
F               G           Am
 We dream of places that we could go
                   C
 Castles with the strange glow
                Dm
 People that we don't know
 I remember
F
 We left the light
 G          Am
 That's ordinary from the start
C
 We look for stranger things
        Dm
 'Cause that's just who we are
F              G              Am
 Found me the edges something beautiful than love
C                    Dm
 Like I'm picturing now

CHORUS

F          G           Am
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
    C                      Dm
But I'm just looking after you tonight
F            G           Am
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
C                      Dm
Tell me someday we'll get there

Someday
F . G . Am . C . F

Someday
F . G . Am . C . F

Instrumental Part (DJ Thing)
F . G . Am . C . F
F . G . Am . C . F
You can Dance here.

VERSE

F            G       Am
 I see a Technicolor shadow
                 C
 Underneath your window
                  Dm
 Just in case you don't know
 I can see it
F                  G          Am
 You cast among an unfamiliar day glow
                     C
 Different than what I know
                Dm
 Shining like a halo
 I can feel it

F
 We turned our back
 G          Am
 That's ordinary from the start
C
 We look for stranger things
        Dm
 'Cause that's just who we are
F              G              Am
 Found me the edges something beautiful than love
C                        Dm
 Show me the sky falling down

CHORUS

F          G           Am
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
    C                      Dm
But I'm just looking after you tonight
F            G           Am
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
C                      Dm
Tell me someday we'll get there

Someday
F . G . Am . C . F

Someday
F . G . Am . C . F

Instrumental Part (DJ Thing)
F . G . Am . C . F
F . G . Am . C . F
Again, You can Dance here.

F         G
