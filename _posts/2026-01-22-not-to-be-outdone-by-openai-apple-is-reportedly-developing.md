## Apple Joins the AI Hardware Race

The AI hardware market is heating up, and Apple isn't planning to sit on the sidelines. According to a report from The Information, the tech giant is developing its own AI-powered wearable device—a pin that users can attach to their clothing. This move comes just days after OpenAI announced plans to unveil its first hardware device later this year, signaling that the race for AI-enabled gadgets is officially on.

The timing is hardly coincidental. OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane told a Davos audience this week that the company expects to announce its highly anticipated AI hardware—rumored to be a pair of earbuds—in the second half of 2025. Apple, never one to cede ground in the consumer electronics space, appears to be accelerating its own development timeline in response.

## What We Know About Apple's AI Pin

Details about Apple's device paint a picture of a sleek, minimalist gadget that could blend seamlessly into everyday wear. According to the report, the pin is designed as a "thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum-and-glass shell." Apple engineers are working to make it roughly the size of an AirTag, though slightly thicker to accommodate its array of sensors and components.

The feature set sounds ambitious. The pin will reportedly include two cameras—one with a standard lens and another with a wide-angle option—enabling it to capture both photos and video. It will also pack three microphones, a physical button, a speaker, and a Fitbit-style charging strip on its back. This combination of sensors suggests Apple envisions the device as a multimodal AI assistant capable of seeing, hearing, and responding to the world around its wearer.

If the timeline holds, consumers could see this device hit shelves in 2027, with Apple potentially shipping 20 million units at launch. That's a significant production run, indicating the company has serious confidence in the product's potential. TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for comment, but the company has yet to respond—par for the course with its typically secretive approach to product development.

## The Cautionary Tale of Humane AI

Before we get too excited about AI pins becoming the next must-have gadget, there's an important cautionary tale to consider: Humane AI.

Founded by two Apple alums, Humane AI launched its own AI pin with similar features—built-in microphones, a camera, and AI-powered capabilities. The device generated significant buzz before its release, backed by millions in venture capital and high expectations. But reality proved harsh. The product flopped spectacularly upon launch, failing to capture consumer interest despite its innovative pitch.

Within just two years of launching its product, Humane AI was forced to shut down operations and sell its assets to HP. The failure raises a critical question: Do consumers actually want this kind of AI device?

The answer isn't clear. Wearable technology has had a mixed track record. Smartwatches found their niche after years of refinement, but products like Google Glass and various smart rings have struggled to find mainstream adoption. The challenge isn't just technical—it's about finding a compelling use case that justifies adding another device to our already crowded tech ecosystems.

## Why This Time Might Be Different

That said, Apple has a few advantages that Humane AI lacked. First, the company has an established ecosystem of devices and services that could integrate seamlessly with an AI pin. Second, Apple has proven expertise in making wearable technology desirable—just look at the Apple Watch and AirPods. Third, the AI landscape has matured significantly, with large language models becoming more capable and efficient.

The competition with OpenAI also adds an interesting dynamic. OpenAI brings cutting-edge AI capabilities but lacks hardware experience. Apple has world-class hardware design but has been playing catch-up in AI. A hardware race between these two companies could push both to innovate faster, potentially creating better products for consumers.

Still, success is far from guaranteed. These devices will need to prove they can do something smartphones can't—or at least do it significantly better. They'll need to overcome privacy concerns about always-on cameras and microphones. And they'll need to be affordable, reliable, and genuinely useful in everyday life.

*Key Takeaways:*
- Apple is reportedly developing an AI pin with dual cameras and three microphones, potentially launching in 2027
- The move follows OpenAI's announcement of its own AI hardware device coming in late 2025
- Humane AI's failed AI pin serves as a warning that consumer demand for this category remains unproven
- Apple may be accelerating development to compete directly with OpenAI in the emerging AI hardware market
