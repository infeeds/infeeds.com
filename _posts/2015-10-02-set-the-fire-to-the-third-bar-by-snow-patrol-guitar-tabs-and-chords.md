VERSE :

Bm           A              G 
 I find the map and draw a straight line
```

```
Bm      A                 G    
 Over rivers, farms, and state lines
```

```
Bm                A             G
 The distance from 'A' to where you'd be
```

```
Bm          A                  G
 It's only finger-lengths that I see
```

```
Bm            A G 
 I touch the place 
Bm                   A G
 where I'd find your face
```

```
Bm              A  G
 My fingers in creases 
Bm               A   G
 of distant dark places
```

`Bm           A            G`

```
I hang my coat up in the first bar
```

`Bm             A                  G`

There is no peace that I've found so far

```
The laughter penetrates my silence
```

`Bm           A                G`

```
As drunken men find flaws in science
```

`Bm                  A   G`

```
Their words mostly noises
Bm                A   G
 Ghosts with just voices
```

```
Bm                A    G
 Your words in my memory
```

 Are like music to me
```

Bm              D
 I'm miles from where you are,

A               G
 I lay down on the cold ground ,I
```

Bm                     D
 I pray that something picks me up

 And sets me down in your warm arms

 After I have travelled so far

 We'd set the fire to the third bar
```

Bm                A            G
 We'd share each other like an island
```

```
Bm         A                G
 Until exhausted, close our eyelids
```

```
Bm                  A     G
 And dreaming, pick up from
```

```
Bm                 A      G
 The last place we left off
```

```
Bm                 A     G
 Your soft skin is weeping
```

Bm               A     G
 A joy you can't keep in
