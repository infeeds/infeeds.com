Chords : Am . C . G . D . F

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]

Am C G D 
Oh,   yeah, 
  Am C  G  D
alright, Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]

         Am              C           G           D
Everyone knows all about my direction and in my heart somewhere
        Am                          C
I wanna go there, but still I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

                G
Everybody says "say something"
               D
Say something, say something
                     Am
Let's say something, say something
                 C
Let's say something
                 G                 D
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
              Am                        C                G
When I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the middle of it
            Am                       C                  G
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

                   Am                        C
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                   G                        D
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton]

         Am              C                G
Everyone knows all about my transgression
             D                  Am         C
Still in my heart somewhere, in melody and harmony
G              D
You and me, tonight
  Am               C
Whoa, I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton]

                G
Everybody says "say something"
               D
Say something, say something
                     Am
Let's say something, say something
                 C
Let's say something
                 G                 D
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
              Am                        C                G
When I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the middle of it
            Am                       C                  G
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake] x2

                   Am
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                   C
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                  G
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                  D
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

Am . C

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]

               G                               D

F . G . Am
               C                               G

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake & Choir]

             Am                      C                 G
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the middle of it
                Am                   C                  G
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
                 D
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake] x2

                   Am
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                   C
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                  G
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
                  D
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]

               G                               D
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing at all

F . G . Am 
               C                               G
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing at all

F . G . Am
               C                               G
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing
