It’s that time of year again when thoughts turn to spring and the warmer weather that comes with it. And for those of you who are getting married, that means wedding planning is in full swing! If you’re looking for some top tips on how to make your British spring wedding perfect, then look no further. From choosing the right venue to dealing with the weather, we’ve got everything covered. So whether you’re just starting to plan your big day or you’re in the final stages of preparation, read on for our top tips on how to make your spring wedding one to remember.

## Location

When planning a British spring wedding, one of the most important things to consider is the location. There are many beautiful locations across the UK that would be perfect for a spring wedding, but it’s important to choose a venue that will fit your specific needs and budget. Here are a few tips to help you choose the perfect location for your British spring wedding:

1\. Consider the weather: One of the great things about having a spring wedding in Britain is that you can never predict the weather! While this can be a bit of a gamble, it also means that you could have beautiful sunshine or stunningly romantic rain on your big day. Be sure to consider the weather when choosing your wedding location, and have a backup plan in case of inclement weather.

2\. Think about your guests: Another important factor to consider when choosing a location for your British spring wedding is your guests. Will they be able to travel easily to your chosen venue? Is there accommodation nearby for out-of-town guests? Make sure you consider these factors when making your decision.

3\. Choose a budget-friendly location: Spring is typically a busy time for weddings, so prices can be inflated at popular venues. If you’re on a tight budget, consider opting for a less traditional (and less expensive) location for your nuptials. There are plenty of beautiful places across the UK that won’t break the bank.

4\. Find a venue with character: One of the

## Weather

When it comes to planning a spring wedding in Britain, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to the weather. First and foremost, be prepared for anything! The British weather is notoriously unpredictable, so while you may be dreaming of a sunny spring day, there’s always the chance that it could turn out to be cold and rainy.

That being said, there are a few things you can do to help ensure that your spring wedding is as perfect as possible, no matter what the weather throws at you. Here are our top tips:

– Choose a venue with indoor and outdoor space. This way, if the weather does take a turn for the worse, you’ve got a back-up plan.

– Have contingency plans for both rain and shine. If you’re planning an outdoor ceremony or reception, make sure you have a wet weather alternative ready to go, just in case. Likewise, if you’re hoping for good weather, have a backup plan for if it turns out to be hot instead (think cooling drinks and shady spots).

– Embrace the British weather! If it does happen to rain on your wedding day, there’s no need to let it ruin your day. Just grab a cute umbrella and make the most of it!

## Guests

When it comes to guests, there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure your British spring wedding is perfect. First, invite only those who you really want to be there- this isn’t the time to try and impress everyone you know. Second, make sure you have plenty of activities planned so that guests can enjoy themselves even if the weather isn’t ideal. Finally, don’t forget to send out save-the-dates so that everyone can plan accordingly!

## Confetti

If you’re looking to add a touch of elegance to your British spring wedding, consider using [dried petal confetti](https://www.confettibee.co.uk/collections/natural-confetti). This type of confetti is made from real flower petals, so it’s environmentally friendly and biodegradable. Plus, it’s sure to add a beautiful touch to your big day!

When choosing petal confetti, be sure to select a variety that will complement your wedding colors. For example, if you’re having a pink and green-themed wedding, opt for rose petals in shades of pink and white. If you want something a little more unique, try using lavender or marigold petals.

Once you’ve selected your confetti, be sure to ask your florist for advice on how to best apply it. They’ll be able to help you choose the right type of confetti (either loose or in tubes), as well as the best way to apply it so that it looks great in photos and lasts throughout the night!

## Attire

The British spring is a time of year when the weather can be unpredictable. It can be warm and sunny one day, and cold and rainy the next. So, what should you wear to a British spring wedding?

Here are some tips:

1\. Choose your attire based on the weather forecast. If the forecast calls for rain, choose an outfit that will keep you dry and comfortable. If the forecast predicts warm weather, opt for a lighter weight fabric.

2\. Consider layering your clothing. Wearing a dress or skirt with a cardigan or jacket is a good way to stay warm if the temperature dips.

3\. Don’t forget about accessories! A pretty scarf, belt, or piece of jewelry can add just the right finishing touch to your outfit.

4\. Comfort is key. No matter what the weather is like, you want to be able to enjoy yourself at the wedding. So make sure your clothes are comfortable and won’t restrict your movement.

5\. Have fun with your outfit! A British spring wedding is the perfect opportunity to experiment with fashion and express your own personal style

## Food and drink

When it comes to food and drink, there are a few key things to keep in mind for a perfect British spring wedding. First, seasonal produce is key – think fresh asparagus, new potatoes and English strawberries. For drinks, serve up Pimm’s cocktails or English sparkling wine to really get guests into the spirit of the occasion!

As far as catering goes, why not go for a traditional afternoon tea? This can be easily served outside if the weather is good, and will definitely be a talking point among guests. Another option is to have a BBQ or picnic style lunch – perfect for making the most of the warmer weather. Just make sure you have plenty of options to cater for all dietary requirements.

And last but not least, don’t forget the cake! A classic Victoria sponge is always a winner, or you could go for something more creative like a naked cake adorned with fresh flowers.
