Driveways require regular maintenance, and through years of use, there comes a point when they need to be replaced. A worn-out driveway can be an eyesore to the exterior of your home but with the help of a professional, your driveway can get a well-needed facelift.

The longer you leave certain issues, the more work will need to be done, so below are four tell-tale signs that it’s time to replace your driveway sooner rather than later.

## Cracks on Driveways

When cracks start to appear on your driveway, this is one of the most apparent signs that it either needs to be repaired or replaced. Cracks occur more commonly on driveways built with asphalt or concrete and are usually caused by wear and tear combined with old age. Cracks on your driveway don’t look great and can also enable further damage to occur.

If certain substances get into the cracks, such as gas or oil, they can cause the cracks to increase in size. At the first sign of cracks in your driveway, it is best to seek advice from a professional specialising in [Driveways Solihull](https://heritagedrivesandlandscapes.co.uk/).

## Poor Drainage System

Your driveway should be installed with a type of drainage system (if it isn’t, it’s time to replace your driveway right now). After a rainy day, your driveway should not be left with huge puddles. If this is the case, the drainage system requires further investigation or perhaps a full replacement of your driveway is in order.

Poor drainage on the driveway can be frustrating, especially when trying to get in and out of your car without getting your feet wet. Excess water can also weaken the surface of your driveway, causing potholes and cracks to form.

## Weed Growth on Different Places

When weeds can surface on your driveway, this is typically a sign that your driveway needs replaced. Whilst [persistent weeds](https://www.gardeningetc.com/advice/how-to-get-rid-of-weeds-and-stop-them-from-spreading) may grow around the sides of your driveway and home, we are talking about weeds appearing through cracks or holes in the middle of your drive, in places you’ve never noticed them before.

The foundation of your driveway could be damaged, which has allowed the weeds to grow through. You can kill the weeds, but the damage has likely already been done.

## Potholes on Driveways

You wouldn’t like to drive down a road covered in potholes, so do you really want them on your driveway? Any potholes on your driveway are a sure-fire sign that it needs to be replaced or resurfaced. Potholes also make it easier for water to collect on your driveway, which will only worsen the pothole over time.

[Potholes can be a nuisance for cars](https://www.fosterandheanesltd.co.uk/cars-maintenance/73-what-damage-can-potholes-cause-to-your-car) and larger vehicles and could cause damage to the suspension and wheels of your vehicle. If you do have a pothole, it is best to get this replaced sooner rather than later and avoid driving or parking over it.

If you notice weeds, cracks, potholes, or poor drainage on your driveway, this could be a tell-tale sign that you need a driveway replacement. Taking care of your driveway will keep the exterior of your home looking nice and ensure that any damage is repaired before it gets worse.
