**An Overview of CPR**

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, is an emergency medical process. Used in cases such as cardiac arrest or drowning.

CPR works by restoring some blood flow to the heart and brain, providing oxygen to these vital organs. It requires compressing the chest area of the patient in a rhythmic manner.

CPR is an important life skill to learn and is available as a class or online. It provides instructions on how to recognize and treat cardiac and breathing emergencies.

Some key benefits of knowing CPR is recognizing medical emergencies and reacting quickly. It also empowers individuals to feel confident and capable of saving a life. Especially in the event of an emergency, which can be the most rewarding benefit of all.

CPR training teaches people how to identify cardiac arrest and heart attack. Both are serious medical emergencies that need immediate action.

Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart has an electrical problem. It prohibits the heart from effectively pumping blood. It is often sudden and can lead to death without immediate medical attention.

A heart attack is when the heart does not have an adequate blood supply. This happens due to the narrowing of the coronary arteries. Symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, shortness of breath, and perspiration.
