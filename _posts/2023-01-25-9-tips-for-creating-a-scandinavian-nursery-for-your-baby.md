**Decorating your baby’s nursery is an exciting time for all new parents. It gives you the opportunity to create a special space for your baby that is comfortable, secure, and filled with love.**

There are so many different nursery styles that you can pick, from traditional and classic to modern and sleek. You can match your baby’s nursery to the rest of your house’s interior design, or you can make it stand out with a unique style of its own.

One popular choice of nursery style that we love is **Scandanavian**. This style is all about creating a **cosy, comfortable atmosphere** using Nordic-inspired designs and colours.

If you’re interested in creating a Scandanavian nursery for your baby, here are **nine tips to help you get started**:

## **1. Choose Neutral Colours**

When creating a Scandinavian nursery, it’s best to **avoid bright colours or bold patterns**. Instead, opt for neutral tones like whites, greys, and light browns to give the room a calm atmosphere and a clean look.

While you don’t have to stick to just neutrals, these colours should be incorporated into the design in order to keep the room from feeling overwhelming or cluttered.

## **2. Utilise Natural Elements**

Incorporate elements from nature into your Nordic-style nursery with **natural materials** like wood and stone. This adds texture to the room and creates an **inviting atmosphere** that mimics the outdoors – perfect for soothing your little one during nap time or playtime!

Look for decorative pieces made from natural materials and furniture pieces with wooden legs or frames.

And you could even add in some houseplants for a touch of greenery! Of course, make sure that any plants you add are safe for your baby.

## **3. Add Minimal Furniture**

A Scandinavian nursery should be kept **simple and minimal**, so fill it with only the essentials. You don’t want the space to feel cluttered, so stick to just the basics like a crib, dresser, and changing table.

Choose furniture pieces that are low-slung and made from natural materials like wood. This will help give the nursery an airy feel while also providing your baby with the necessary furnishings.

[Snuz](https://www.snuz.co.uk/3-piece-furniture-sets/) is all about **Scandi-inspired nursery design**. And their nursery furniture sets won’t only add a touch of Scandi-style to your baby’s room, but also provide you with the perfect pieces for creating a comfortable and secure space for your little one.

## **4. Pick Simple Patterns**

When choosing fabric designs such as curtains or bed sheets, choose simple patterns like **stripes or geometric shapes** rather than complicated prints that may distract from the overall aesthetic of your Scandinavian-inspired nursery.

Additionally, try not to go too overboard with colour – it’s best if all fabrics are pulled together by similar shades rather than clashing hues that don’t match up nicely!

## **5. Add Textures And Greenery**

That being said, experimenting with textures can be a great way to add dimension to your nursery without taking away from the overall simplicity of it.

Look for textured furniture pieces like **rattan chairs, woven rugs and knitted cushions**. You can even hang wall art pieces with interesting textures on them!

And again, houseplants can be a great addition to a Scandinavian nursery. Try and stick to leafy greens that are safe for babies, as well as larger statement plants like ferns or palms. **There’s also nothing wrong with fake plants!**

## **6. Place A Rug In The Room**

Rugs are great additions to any room because they bring warmth and comfort – especially when it comes to nurseries which should always have soft surfaces for babies to crawl around on or lay down on during playtime.

Rugs can make a room feel really **cosy and homely** – crucial for any nursery.

Look for neutral-coloured rugs with subtle patterns to add some texture and visual interest without overwhelming the room.

## **7. Install Wall Art**

Wall art is important because it can tie together all other pieces within the room – plus, it adds some **personality and visual interest** at the same time!

Consider incorporating some classic Nordic prints featuring minimalist shapes like circles &amp; triangles – also, think about using **wall decals** featuring animals and plants, which will look great against neutral-coloured walls!

## **8. Add Storage Solutions**

Every parent will tell you that baby’s come with a lot of stuff. Nappies, clothes, toys – you name it! So make sure you have some kind of storage solution in the nursery to help **keep everything neat and organised.**

Look for furniture pieces that double up as storage solutions. This can be anything from a low-slung bookcase or a chest of drawers – even a baby changing table with shelves and compartments.

## **9. Consider Hanging Light Fixtures**

Ambient lighting gives off a warm glow and helps create a relaxing atmosphere – so consider investing in some hanging light fixtures around the room.

For example, lighting that hangs from the ceiling or a wall-mounted light. Choose fixtures with **soft illumination** and avoid anything that has harsh lighting tones. This will help create a [calming atmosphere](https://www.healthline.com/health/best-color-light-for-sleep) and provide some extra warmth to the room.

## **Conclusion: Get Inspired With These Tips for a Scandinavian Nursery!**

The options really are endless when it comes to interior design, but if you’re looking for a simple yet stylish way to decorate your baby’s nursery, then look no further than **Scandi-inspired design**.

A Scandinavian nursery creates a really calming and beautiful space for your baby – it’s all about neutral colours, minimalist shapes and simple patterns.
