VERSE

               A#   Cm
Emotions like summer
                  D#     Gm
We'll wait for a blue sky
                 A#     Cm
And I turned to hold you
                   D#    Gm
As we watched the sunrise
                 A#    Cm
'Cause this is amazing
                  D#  Gm
Running wild with you
                 A#  Cm
My thoughts are hazy
                    D#   Gm
This may be way too soon

CHORUS

But I will never let you go
                  F  Gm
Never let you go, at all
F      D#      
I will never let you go
                  F  Gm   F
Never let you go, at all

Ooh, ooh

I'm so lost in these summer nights
                D#           Gm
So lost in your crystal light
                   A#          Cm
And even when this night is day
                   D#              Gm
I won't regret the words I'm saying
