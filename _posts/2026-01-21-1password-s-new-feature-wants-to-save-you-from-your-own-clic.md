Phishing attacks are getting smarter, and let's be honest, most of us are still clicking links we probably shouldn't. That sketchy email from "Amaz0n" asking you to verify your account? Yeah, someone's falling for it every single day.

1Password is stepping in with a new feature that acts like a slightly paranoid friend who grabs your arm before you walk into traffic. When you click a link that takes you to a website with a URL that doesn't match what's saved in your password vault, the browser extension will refuse to autofill your credentials. Instead, you'll get a pop-up warning that basically says "Hey, this doesn't look right."

## The Economics of Getting Phished

Here's the part that should make your [Business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) alarm bells ring. IBM research shows that a successful phishing attack costs companies an average of $4.8 million. That's not a typo. One employee clicking the wrong link can trigger a cascade of problems that end up costing more than most people's mortgages.

The new feature from 1Password is designed to catch those moments when you're moving too fast and not paying attention to the URL bar. You know, like when "paypa1.com" tries to pass itself off as the real thing with a sneaky number instead of the letter L.

## Not a Silver Bullet

But let's pump the brakes on calling this a complete solution. You can still manually copy and paste your credentials into a suspicious site if you really want to. The [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) isn't going to physically stop you from making bad decisions. It's more like a speed bump than a brick wall.

The feature is rolling out now, though it might take a few weeks to reach everyone. If you're on an individual or family plan, 1Password is turning this on by default, which is probably the right move. Most people won't enable security features themselves even when they should. For business users, admins will need to flip the switch manually.

It's worth noting that this approach only works if you've actually been using 1Password to save your logins in the first place. If you're one of those people who still keeps passwords in a text file on your desktop or uses the same password everywhere, well, this won't help you much.

The real question is whether these kinds of guardrails will actually change user behavior or just become another notification people learn to ignore, like cookie consent banners or that nagging update reminder you've been dismissing for three weeks.
