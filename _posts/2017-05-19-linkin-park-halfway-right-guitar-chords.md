   A                            D               F#m
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
```

```
A                         D                       F#m
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

```

Abandoned houses where the shadows live
```

```

I never been higher than I was that night
```

```
F#m
I woke up driving my car
```

```
A                        Bm
I couldn't see then what I see right now
```

```
F#m
The road dissolving like an empty vow
```

```
A                  Bm
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
```

```

I knew I took it too far

D               A

`All you said to do was slow down`

```
E                    F#m
 I remember, now I remember
```

```
D               A
All you said to do was slow down
```

```

 But I was already gone

```
A                         D                       F#m

```

```
A                        D                   F#m
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
```

```
A                         D                       F#m
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)

VERSE

A                          Bm
```
`Told me "Kid, you're going way to fast`

```
F#m
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last"
```

```
A                         Bm
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
```

```
F#m
I woke up driving my car
```

```
A                      Bm
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
```

```
F#m
I just laughed because what do they know?
```

```
A                   Bm
Here I am, standing all alone
```

```
F#m
Because I took it too far

Semi-Chorus

D               A

 I remember, now I remember
```

```
D               A
All you said to do was slow down
```

```
E 
 But I was already gone

CHORUS
```

```
A                            D               F#m
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
        A                         D                       F#m
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
  A                        D                   F#m
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
        A                         D                       F#m
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

Na na na na
D . A . E . F#m
D . A . E

I was already gone
```
Repeat the CHORUS.

End.
