I'm Playing with 2 Steps Down

Here We Go -

```
Gmin                                 A#                     
I try to make it through my life, 
         F               D# 
In my way there's You

Gmin                                     A#
I try to make it through these lies,
                F     D#
And that's all I do.

Em
Just don't deny it,
Em
Don't try to fight this,
      D
And deal with it,
C               D^ [Downstrumm of D] : Optional
And that's just part of it..

CHORUS :

Em                               G  
If You were dead or Still alive..
           D
I Don't Care
          C        
I Don't Care

Em                                  G
Just go and leave this all behind,
           D
Cause i swear,
           C
I Don't Care...

Em
I try to make you see my side,
Em
I always try to stay in line,
D                                   C
But your eyes see right through
C
That's all they do

Em
I'm getting buried in this place
Em
I've got no room, you're in my face
D                               C
Don't say anything just go away

CHORUS :

Em                               G  
If You were dead or Still alive..
           D
I Don't Care
          C        
I Don't Care

Em                                  G
Just go and leave this all behind,
           D
Cause i swear,
           C
I Don't Care...

G........D........

Em                      
I'm not changing everything,
         Em
'cause you won't be there for me

G........D........

Em                       
I'm not changing everything,
         Em
'cause you won't be there for me

CHORUS :

Em                               G  
If You were dead or Still alive..
           D
I Don't Care
          C        
I Don't Care

Em                                  G
Just go and leave this all behind,

Cause i swear,

I Don't Care...
```
