TUNING : STANDARD [EADGBe]
CAPO : 2nd Fret

INTRO :
Am . F . C

VERSE :

Am
 If I could face them
```

```
F                      C
 If I could make amends with all my shadows
```

```
Am              F          C
 I'd bow my head and welcome them
```

```
Am
 But I feel it burning
F
```

```
Like when the winter wind
```

```
C
 Stops my breathing
```

```
Am
```

```
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
```

```
F
 I fear you won't
```

```
C
 I fear you don't
```

`Pre-Chorus :`

```
F               Am
```

`And it echoes when I breathe`

```
G
Until all you see is my ghost
```

```
F                Am
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
```

```
G
Wish you could see
```

```
CHORUS :
```

`And they call me under`

```
F          C            Am     
 And I'm shaking like a leaf
```

```
G
 And they call me under
```

`F       C          Am`

```
And I wither underneath
```

```
G
```

```
In this storm
```

```
VERSE :
```

```
Am
 I am a stranger
```

```
F             C
 I am an alien inside a structure
```

```
Am
```

```
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
```

```
F
 With all my thoughts
```

```
C
 And all my faults
```

`Am`

```
I feel it biting
```

```
F                      C
 I feel it break my skin so uninviting
```

```
Am
 Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone?
```

```
F
 I fear you won't
```

```
C
 I fear you don't
```

`Pre-Chorus :`

```
F               Am
```

`And it echoes when I breathe`

```
G
```

`Until all you see is my ghost`

```
F                Am
```

`Empty vessel, crooked teeth`

```
G
```

`Wish you could see`

```
CHORUS :
```

`And they call me under`

```
F          C            Am
```

```
And I'm shaking like a leaf
```

```
G
```

```
And they call me under
```

`F       C          Am`

```
And I wither underneath
```

```
G
```

```
In this storm I feel it
```

```F`Â 
```
C
```

```
And they call me under
```

```
Am         G            F
 And I'm shaking like a leaf
```

```
C          Am
```

```
And they call me underneath
```

```
G
```

```
To this storm

 Am . F . C
 Am . F . C

End.
```
