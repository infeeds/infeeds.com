Thailand is renowned for its healthcare, and it has become one of the world's leading medical tourism destinations. But arranging to visit the country for treatment is one thing; living there and needing urgent treatment for an unexpected bout of poor health is another. While comparatively cheaper than healthcare in many other countries, Thailand's hospital bills may still be more than most people have available in savings.

Yet many people still wonder whether health insurance in Thailand for expats is necessary. To help answer that question, here are some of the ways it affects foreign residents in the country.

**It Provides Access to Private Hospitals**

Thailand has a public healthcare system, but its hospitals are not as well-equipped to deal with foreign patients as the private sector. Their affordability comes at the cost of long waits, fewer choices around treatments, and often a language barrier. However, the country's private hospitals are among the best international hospitals in the world. Thailand expat health insurance typically gives you access to these.

Inside, you'll find world-class doctors, English-speaking staff, shorter wait times and more choices when it comes to treatments and procedures.

**It Is Sometimes Mandatory**

When it comes to [health insurance Thailand for foreigners](https://www.bsibroker.co.th/en/health-insurance/) is not very strict. For most expats living in the country, it is an option. However, there are some visa types, such as the retirement visa, that do require it. The policies taken out by people in these categories must also meet minimum thresholds that are set by the Thai government.

For other visa types, such as working visas, insurance is not specifically listed as a requirement. However, the immigration officers have some discretion and may ask for it if you're planning to stay long-term.

**It Is Likely to be a Requirement in Future**

One important [thing to know about health insurance in Thailand for expats](https://infeeds.com/things-you-should-know-about-health-insurance-for-foreigners-living-in-thailand) is that it's being increasingly seen as important by Thai politicians. Unpaid hospital bills skyrocketed early in the COVID-19 pandemic, leading the government to make insurance a requirement for most visitors. While this has since been relaxed, the direction immigration policy seems to be heading is towards mandatory health insurance for more visitors and foreign residents.

**It Is a Big Decision**

Expat medical insurance in Thailand is usually taken out with a local Thai insurer, an international one, or by combining both. There's no single "best health insurance for foreigners in Thailand." Typically, the Thai policies tend to be cheaper, and you can find ones that cater to the minimum coverage required for certain visas, but there can sometimes be many limits and exclusions in the fine print.

International policies may offer wider coverage and provide a better fit for your lifestyle, but they also tend to cost more.

**Conclusion**

[Access to health services for foreign workers](https://thailand.go.th/public/issue-focus-detail/007_037) and residents in Thailand is important. You never know when an illness or injury may happen, or what your financial situation will be when it does. That's why insurance plays a large role in the lives of most expats living in the kingdom, and it needs to be carefully thought about by anyone thinking of making the move.
