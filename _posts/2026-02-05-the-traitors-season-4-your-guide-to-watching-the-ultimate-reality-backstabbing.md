Reality TV has found its perfect formula with The Traitors, and season 4 is delivering exactly what fans crave: celebrity drama wrapped in psychological warfare. Alan Cumming returns as host, guiding another batch of reality stars through murder mysteries and betrayals at a Scottish castle that's become television's most gorgeous backdrop for cutthroat competition.

The format remains simple but addictive. Traitors secretly eliminate faithfuls while everyone tries to figure out who's lying. Banishments happen. Accusations fly. Trust evaporates faster than morning fog in the Highlands.

## Who's Still Standing in Season 4

Rob Rausch from Love Island USA is still in the mix, along with Survivor's Natalie Anderson and Top Chef's Kristen Kish. The season started with 23 contestants pulled from various reality shows, and seven episodes in, the field has already thinned considerably.

The competition format means you never know who'll make it to the next episode. That uncertainty keeps viewers glued to their screens every Thursday night.

## When and Where to Watch

New episodes drop Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock. Episode 8, titled "A Queen Never Comes Off Her Throne," continues the drama this week. If you're planning to catch up or jump in now, you'll need a Peacock subscription since this is an original series exclusive to the streaming platform.

The [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) behind streaming has changed how we consume reality TV, making weekly releases feel almost nostalgic in an era where everything usually drops at once.

## The Peacock Subscription Puzzle

Here's where it gets slightly annoying. Peacock offers three tiers, but only two actually let you watch The Traitors. The Premium plan runs $11 monthly with ads, while Premium Plus costs $17 for mostly ad-free viewing. That "mostly" qualifier matters because even Premium Plus subscribers will see commercials during live sports and certain other content.

The cheaper Select plan at $8 per month exists but won't give you access to Peacock originals like The Traitors. It's a weird [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) decision that forces viewers into higher tiers if they want the platform's signature content.

There's also a bundle option pairing Peacock with Apple TV for $15 monthly if you want ad-supported Peacock and ad-free Apple TV. Bumping to ad-free Peacock brings the bundle to $20. Whether that's worth it depends on how much you use both services.

## What's Coming Next

Peacock already renewed The Traitors for season 5, showing confidence in the format. More interesting is the civilian version coming to NBC with Cumming hosting. Applications are open through March 10 if you think you've got what it takes to lie convincingly while surrounded by cameras.

The show's success proves audiences still want communal viewing experiences with weekly episodes they can discuss between installments. Something about waiting seven days to see if your favorite gets backstabbed builds anticipation that binge-watching never quite captures.

The real question isn't whether The Traitors will keep drawing viewers but whether the format can sustain itself across multiple seasons without becoming predictable. Right now though, season 4 is hitting all the right notes for anyone who enjoys watching people they recognize from other shows try desperately to outsmart each other while Alan Cumming delivers perfectly timed commentary in a fabulous wardrobe.
