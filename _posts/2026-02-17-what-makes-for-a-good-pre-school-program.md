If your young child is rapidly reaching the age when pre-school is on the cards, this is definitely an exciting time, and of course, you want to choose the best early learning program in your area, which is perfectly natural. You might be a new parent, and therefore, you have no hands-on experience in bringing up children, and choosing the best program might be challenging.

In this short article, we present a few essential ingredients that make up a successful pre-school program.

* **Manned Security** – There should be manned security during regular opening hours, plus 24/7 surveillance on the facility. The process of collecting children would be complex, and only authorised adults can take possession of children.  
* **Learning Through Fun Activities** – There should be no serious studying in a [**daycare in Liverpool**](https://clovelchildcare.com.au/childcare-liverpool/); activities should include dance, movement, games and art, all activities that are ideal for young growing kids. Activities would last 10-20 minutes and would happen 3-4 times per day.  
* **Wholesome Food & Snacks** – Your child should only receive healthy refreshment, and there will be choices; you can communicate with the carers to choose drinks and snacks. There should be no evidence of soda drinks or any other unhealthy processed food and drink products.  
* **Qualified Teachers/Carers** – Staff would be a mixture of experienced pre-school teachers and young trainees who are carrying out part of the degree course by working with young children. The ratio should be 7:1 with no more than 20 per class, which allows the teacher and their assistant to give each child the attention he or she needs.  
* **Happy Ambience** – There should be a positive energy and an air of happiness and joy, which comes from hosting a large number of happy children. Fun must be at the top of the list for a pre-school or kindergarten, and that would show.

* **Parental Participation** – The parents should be given every opportunity to become involved in school activities, while there should be monthly workshops to help parents understand active learning and techniques to use at home to stimulate enquiry. Some childcare centres use a digital forum for carers and parents to communicate, while others have a small notebook that’s kept in the child’s bag.  
* **Facebook Group** – Every Australian childcare centre should create a Facebook group for the parents, which helps parents keep in touch with what’s happening. This is a great place to visit if you are thinking of taking your child to the childcare centre, as you will discover how parents feel about the institution.  
* **Ongoing Staff Training** – Carers need ongoing training to keep up with new learning strategies, and a top childcare centre would arrange for education experts to visit the school and deliver a workshop.
