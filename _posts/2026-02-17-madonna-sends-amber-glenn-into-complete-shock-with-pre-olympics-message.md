Imagine preparing for the biggest moment of your athletic career, and then your idol slides into your DMs. Well, sort of. That's essentially what happened to U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn, who received a personal video message from Madonna herself ahead of her short program performance at the Milan Winter Olympics.

Glenn is skating to Madonna's 1989 hit "Like A Prayer" on Tuesday, and the pop icon decided to send some love her way before the big day. In a clip shared by NBC's On Her Turf, you can watch Glenn's reaction in real time, and it's honestly the most genuine thing you'll see all week.

## When Your Queen Notices You

"I have to tell, I was blown away by it. You are an incredible skater," Madonna said in the video message. Glenn literally covered her mouth in shock. The kind of shock that makes you question if you're dreaming or if someone's playing a prank on you.

But Madonna wasn't done. She went on to call Glenn "so strong, so beautiful" and "so brave," adding that she can't imagine the skater not winning at the Games. "So I just want to say good luck. Go get that gold," the pop legend concluded.

Glenn's response was everything. "Sorry, I'm in shock, I'm in complete shock. Oh my god! I'm legitimately shaking. Oh my god!" she exclaimed. If you've ever had a celebrity crush, you know exactly that feeling. The one where your brain stops working and you can only repeat the same words over and over.

## More Than Just a Performance

Glenn isn't just casually skating to a Madonna song. She worked with one of Madonna's actual dancers to prepare for this moment. Her dress is inspired by the icon herself. This is a whole production, a love letter on ice to one of pop music's most influential figures.

The fact that Glenn is the first openly queer woman to represent Team USA in women's singles figure skating adds another layer to this story. Madonna has long been an ally and icon in the LGBTQ+ community, so this connection feels particularly meaningful. The pop star even called Glenn a "Baddie on Ice" on her Instagram Stories last week, which is possibly the coolest nickname an athlete could receive.

Glenn is competing alongside her U.S. teammates Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito in what Americans are calling the "Blade Angels" trio. The short program competition starts at 12:45 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and you can bet Glenn will have some extra motivation carrying her through every jump and spin.

"Thank you for supporting athletes in their artistic ventures, and I hope I can do the song justice," Glenn said in her response to Madonna. It's a sweet sentiment, but honestly, after getting that kind of endorsement from the Material Girl herself, Glenn has already won something bigger than a medal. She's won the validation of someone who has spent decades pushing boundaries and inspiring people to be exactly who they are, no apologies needed.
