## **What to Expect From an Adult Jazz Dance Class**

When it comes to adult [jazz dance classes](https://www.lovetoknow.com/life/lifestyle/history-jazz-dance), there’s no need to feel intimidated or nervous. These classes are designed for adults of all ages and skill levels.

This makes them a welcoming environment for jazz dance for beginners. Below, let’s look into what else you can expect.

### **Warm-Up**

Most adult jazz dance classes will start with a warm-up. This is an essential part of any dance class as it helps prepare your body for the movements to come.

The warm-up typically includes stretches and cardio exercises to get your heart rate up and loosen up your muscles. Warming up is crucial to prevent injury and ensure that you can dance moves safely.

### **Technical Exercises**

After the warm-up, you can expect to do some technical exercises. These will help you improve your technique and build your strength and flexibility.

Technical exercises may include isolations, turns, leaps, and kicks. Don’t worry if these seem challenging at first – with practice, they will become easier!

### **Across-the-Floor Combinations**

In jazz dance, “across-the-floor” exercises are used to help dancers improve their movement across the dance floor. This is a great way to work on transitions and coordination.

These exercises typically involve traveling steps, turns, and jumps from one side of the room to the other. This means you’ll have plenty of space to practice and perfect your moves!

### **Choreography Learning**

One of the most exciting parts of adult jazz dance classes is learning choreography. In these classes, you’ll learn a variety of jazz dance routines set to different songs.

The choreography will incorporate the techniques and movements learned in class, allowing you to put them into practice. With each class, you’ll learn a new routine and add it to your dance repertoire.

### **Style and Expression**

In addition to learning the technical aspects of jazz dance, adult classes also focus on style and expression. Jazz dance is known for its dynamic and expressive nature, so these classes will encourage you to let go and have fun while dancing.

Style and expression can be challenging to master, but with the right instructor and lots of practice, you’ll be able to add your flare to each dance routine. Each style and expression is unique, so don’t be afraid to let your personality shine through!

## **How to Prepare For an Adult Jazz Dance Class**

When it comes to preparing for an adult jazz dance class, there are a few things you can do to make your experience even better. Without these preparations, you may not be able to perform your best. So let’s talk about what you need.

### **Choose Appropriate Attire**

First and foremost, know what to wear for jazz dance. It’s essential to wear comfortable clothing that allows you to move freely. Jazz dance is a high-energy dance form that requires a lot of movement, so you want to make sure your clothing doesn’t restrict you.

For footwear, jazz shoes are the most common choice. However, if you don’t have jazz shoes, any type of flexible and supportive shoe will do. Or, you can even dance barefoot.

### **Bring the Right Accessories**

Some adult jazz dance classes may require you to bring certain accessories, such as a water bottle or towel. Check with a [dance teacher](https://www.danceteacherweb.com/en/resources/dance-teacher/) beforehand so that you come prepared.

Additionally, if there are any specific props needed for the choreography, the instructor will likely let you know in advance. You can find these props at most dance supply stores or online.

### **Familiarize Yourself with the Studio**

If it’s your first time attending an adult jazz dance class, it’s a good idea to arrive early and familiarize yourself with the studio. This will help you feel more comfortable and confident in the space.

Also, take note of where the restrooms and water fountains are located so that you can easily access them during breaks. These are essential to stay hydrated and refreshed during the class.

### **Stay Hydrated and Energized**

It’s essential to stay hydrated and energized for your jazz dance class. Make sure to bring a water bottle and drink plenty of water throughout the day leading up to your class.

Eating a light snack before class can also help keep your energy levels up. Avoid eating heavy meals close to the start of class, as this may make you feel sluggish or uncomfortable during the movements.

You can also bring a small snack, such as fruit or [energy bars](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/protein-bars-vs-energy-bars-whats-the-difference/), to eat during breaks if needed. There’s nothing worse than feeling dehydrated or hungry during a dance class!

### **Set Realistic Expectations**

It’s crucial to set realistic expectations for yourself. Jazz dance is a challenging dance form, and it may take some time to get the hang of the techniques and choreography.

Remember to be patient with yourself and have fun in the process! With dedication and practice, you’ll see improvement in your skills over time. Without real expectations, you may become discouraged and not enjoy the class as much.
