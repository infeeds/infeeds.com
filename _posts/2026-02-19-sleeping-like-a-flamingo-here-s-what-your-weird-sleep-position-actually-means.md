If you've ever woken up in the middle of the night to find yourself twisted into some bizarre pretzel shape, you're not alone. But there's one particular sleep position that's been getting a lot of attention lately on social media. People are calling it the "flamingo" position, and it's exactly what it sounds like: sleeping on your back with one foot tucked against the opposite leg.

TikTok influencers have latched onto this one, claiming it signals everything from chronic stress to hip pain. But before you start panicking about your nighttime habits, let's talk about what's actually going on here.

## The Hypermobility Connection

Laura Nolan, a psychotherapist who specializes in somatic therapy, sees this sleep position frequently among her clients. According to her, the flamingo stance is most common in people with hypermobility, a condition where joints stretch way beyond their normal range of motion.

People with joint hypermobility syndrome often deal with loose joints, instability, and chronic pain. It's not exactly a party. Nolan also notes an interesting link between hypermobility and neurodivergence. Many neurodivergent adults she works with report unconventional sleep positions, including the flamingo, clenched fists, or what she calls "T. rex hands."

The position might develop as a habit over time. Or maybe you naturally gravitate toward it because of chronic pain or an old injury. Bodies are weird like that. They find what works and stick with it.

## Should You Actually Worry About This?

Here's the thing: sleeping like a flamingo isn't automatically a red flag. Jade Wu, a board-certified sleep psychologist, points out something pretty obvious that social media tends to forget. We naturally sleep in positions that feel comfortable to us.

"Often being in this position simply shows that someone feels most comfortable doing it," Wu explains. Groundbreaking stuff, right?

In fact, if you're doing a side-sleeping variation with one leg up, you might actually be doing yourself a favor. Wu notes this position may lower your risk of sleep apnea and other breathing problems. So much for those stress-filled TikTok theories.

Nolan takes a more curious approach rather than jumping to conclusions about "stuck stress" or body trauma. She's more interested in understanding what feels good about this position for you specifically. Not everything needs to be a [health](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=health) crisis.

## The Downside Nobody Mentions

That said, there is a potential catch. If the flamingo position creates instability for your specific body, it could strain your joints or cause muscle stiffness. Our bodies are complicated machines, and what works for one person might not work for another.

Unless your orthopedic doctor has specifically told you to knock it off, there's no real reason to force yourself to sleep differently. Wu is pretty clear on this point. Don't try to train yourself out of a comfortable sleep position just because someone on the internet said you should.

The bigger issue? Sleep perfectionism. Nolan warns that obsessing over how you sleep can actually make your sleep quality worse, especially if you already struggle with [lifestyle](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=lifestyle) and rest issues. The irony is almost painful.

## Making Your Flamingo Position Work Better

Instead of fighting your body's natural preferences, Nolan suggests getting creative with support. If you're a flamingo sleeper, try putting a pillow under your knees. If you're more of a T. rex sleeper with those clenched fists, hold something soft like a stuffed animal or pillow.

The goal isn't to force yourself into some "perfect" sleep position that looks good on paper but leaves you tossing and turning all night. It's about finding what actually works for your body and supporting it properly.

If you feel stressed at bedtime, that's worth addressing separately. Carve out time to unwind with yoga, mindfulness, or deep breathing after dinner. Nolan recommends progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups while paying attention to how each one feels.

"Remind yourself that stress is not all bad and we have many easy and quick ways of completing the stress response," she says.

Maybe the real lesson here isn't about the flamingo position at all, but about how quickly we jump to pathologize every little quirk about our bodies instead of just letting ourselves be comfortable.
