Here's a wild headline nobody expected to write: President Trump is now calling out Netflix over who sits on its board. And if Netflix doesn't comply, he's promising there will be "consequences." This isn't corporate drama playing out in the gossip columns anymore. This is a former president leveraging his political influence to pressure a streaming giant into firing a specific executive.

The target? Susan Rice, former US Ambassador and national security advisor under Obama and Biden. The demand? Immediate termination from Netflix's board. The reason? Rice recently warned corporations against getting too cozy with Trump, especially if it means breaking the law.

## The Susan Rice Factor

Susan Rice has had a storied career in government. She's held some of the most powerful positions in the national security apparatus. But lately, she's been speaking her mind about corporate responsibility in ways that apparently got under Trump's skin.

In an appearance on the "Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara" podcast just last Thursday, Rice made comments that felt like a direct jab at Trump and his business allies. She warned companies against "taking a knee" to the president if it means skirting the law. She predicted an "accountability agenda" if Democrats regain power. Pretty straightforward stuff, really. But in the current political climate, straightforward criticism apparently gets you put on a hit list.

Trump amplified a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who had already called for action against Rice. The Truth Social post was blunt: terminate her or face consequences. There's no ambiguity here. This is political pressure applied directly to a publicly traded company.

## The Netflix Problem

This gets thorny fast. Netflix is in the middle of pursuing a major [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) deal that requires antitrust approval from the Department of Justice. That's where Trump's influence becomes particularly loaded. A president with concerns about a merger has real power in that process.

Back in December, Trump said Netflix had "very big market share" and the potential Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition "could be a problem." By February, he walked it back slightly, saying he shouldn't be involved and would defer to his DOJ. But let's be real: the message was already out there. Netflix knows where the political winds are blowing.

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently claimed that Trump hasn't requested political concessions during merger talks, and that the focus has been on bringing Hollywood jobs back. Fine. But this new demand about Susan Rice exists in a context where Netflix desperately needs regulatory approval. The timing isn't accidental.

## Why This Matters Beyond the Headlines

What we're watching is a test of corporate independence. Can Netflix keep Rice on its board if doing so irritates a former president? Do they have the spine to say no to political pressure, or will they cave because of merger concerns?

The uncomfortable truth is that Netflix probably has to worry about this. Companies don't operate in a vacuum. When your business requires government approval, you can't entirely ignore the political preferences of powerful figures. That's just the way power works.

Susan Rice hasn't backed down. Representatives for Netflix and Rice haven't immediately responded to requests for comment, which is probably the safest play right now. But the damage is done. Netflix is now caught between its board member's conscience and its business interests.

This situation raises an awkward question that keeps getting worse the longer you think about it: How many corporate boards are going to start purging members based on their political views if they sense administrative pressure? How many business leaders will keep quiet about serious issues just to stay in Trump's good graces?

The streaming wars are brutal enough without adding political warfare to the mix, but here we are.
