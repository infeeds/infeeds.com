Some laptops discount quickly. Others refuse to budge. The Asus Zenbook S 16 has been in the latter camp for what feels like forever, stubbornly hovering around $1,500 even as newer models started creeping onto the horizon. But Best Buy's Presidents' Day sale finally broke the dam, and this thing is now sitting at $1,000. That's $500 off, and honestly, it's the first time this laptop makes complete sense.

I've wanted to recommend this machine for months. It's genuinely one of the best looking Windows laptops released last year, with a sleek profile that doesn't scream "business professional" or "gaming rig." It's just beautiful hardware. The battery life rivals what you'd expect from a MacBook, which is rare praise for any Windows device. And here's the thing that really caught my attention: tech journalists kept showing up to events with this laptop. When people who review dozens of laptops a year keep reaching for the same one, you pay attention.

## The Price Was Always The Problem

But $1,500 was ridiculous. Sure, it came with 24GB of RAM and a full terabyte of storage right out of the gate, but that price tag put it in direct competition with machines that had more going for them in specific categories. The Zenbook was great at everything, exceptional at nothing, and premium pricing needs exceptional.

At $1,000 though? Different story entirely. You're getting that same memory and storage, plus a gorgeous 2880 x 1800 OLED display running at 120Hz. That's the kind of screen that makes everything from editing photos to watching content feel premium. The [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) packed into this chassis was always impressive, it just needed the right price point to match.

## Ports That Actually Make Sense

One detail that doesn't get enough attention is the port situation. Despite being thin enough to slip into basically any bag, Asus kept the legacy connections that actually matter. HDMI, USB-A, and a full-size SD card slot all made the cut. No dongle life here. If you've ever tried to review footage from a camera or plug into a projector without carrying around a small bag of adapters, you know exactly why this matters.

There's a 14-inch version available too, currently priced at $1,300. It's a decent option, but the discount isn't as aggressive and you're giving up screen real estate. Hard to justify unless portability is your absolute top priority.

## The Update Question

Here's where things get interesting. Asus has a 2026 update coming with Intel's latest chips, but it's only hitting the 14-inch model. From testing, those new CPUs make a real difference, especially for graphics performance. But here's my bet: Asus will launch that updated model at an even higher price than the original $1,500, and with memory shortages making headlines in [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) circles, they'll have an excuse to keep it there longer.

So you're looking at either grabbing this proven machine at half off, or waiting for the new hotness that'll probably cost you significantly more for incremental improvements. The math isn't complicated.

If gaming is more your speed, the Asus Zephyrus G14 is also $500 off in the same sale. It's packing an RTX 5070 Ti graphics card and represents a completely different use case, but it's worth mentioning for anyone who needs actual GPU muscle for their work or play.

The Zenbook S 16 at $1,000 isn't just a good deal, it's the deal this laptop should have been from day one, and waiting this long for a reasonable price might have been the smartest move anyone could make.
