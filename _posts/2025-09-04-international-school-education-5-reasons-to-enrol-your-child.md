Education is a critical aspect of growing up. We attend school for 12 years of formal education, then we begin our lives as adults. Of course, every parent wants the very best for their offspring, and in this short article, we take an in-depth look at international school education, presenting compelling reasons to enrol your child in a top international school.

1. **Develop critical thinking skills** - Critical thinking is often overlooked in schools; the focus might be on academic education, which is important, but it isn't everything. International school education is designed to develop critical thinking, and from an early age, students are encouraged to think outside the box. Enrolling your son or daughter at a top-rated [international school in Thailand](https://www.patana.ac.th/) gives them the best possible start in life, and they are more likely to succeed in life.

2. **Learner-centred education** - Project-based learning is a system that is used in most international schools, which brings many benefits. The students work in groups, and they decide what they learn about, which gives them motivation. They choose the format that the project will take; it might be presented on boards, on paper, as a PowerPoint presentation or even as drama. The work is shared among the students, and the teacher is more of a facilitator than an instructor, guiding the students when required.

3. **Great academic scores** - The high GPA scores reflect the standard of academic education, which should enable your child to study at the university of their choosing. As students progress through the school system, the subjects become harder, and if a student has issues, they can study outside the regular program with a local tutor. The bar is set high, and this ensures that students give 100% in examinations and tests.

4. **Develop leadership skills** - Not everyone is leadership material, but if your son/daughter exhibits the ability to lead, they will be encouraged and given all the opportunities to become a strong leader. If you would like to learn more about international school education, book a tour at one of Bangkok's top international schools, and the principal will show you around and answer any questions you might have.

5. **Career counselling** - Starting at Year 9, students spend time with career counsellors, and their role is to assist students in choosing a suitable career. Many secondary school students are unsure what kind of career to pursue, and making mistakes can cost both time and money. Of course, it is essential that a student has a high level of interest when looking at career direction, and they can focus on subjects that are important for a specific career path.

International school education gives students the best possible start in life, and this is an investment that pays big dividends in the long term. Start with a Google search to get a list of international schools in [Bangkok](https://www.bangkok.go.th/) and browse until you find a school that seems suitable.
