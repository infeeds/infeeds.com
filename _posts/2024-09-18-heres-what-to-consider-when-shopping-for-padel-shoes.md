The best shoes can elevate your performance on the track or padel court. Sports shoe manufacturers spend a lot of resources and time curating the ideal footwear that elevates performance while keeping you safe.

Getting the right padel footwear is crucial for optimal performance, whether you are playing for fun or are a seasoned pro. However, the many options from different sports footwear brands can make the process more challenging.

This buyer’s guide will help you navigate the process and choose the ideal padel shoes for match days.

## **Reviews and Budget**

You can ask for shoe recommendations from friends who play padel. However, most [online shops, like Padel USA](https://padelusa.com/collections/padel-shoes), have a review section where past buyers can leave feedback. Ensure that you read reviews before purchasing. The testimonials will let you in on a lot of information related to durability and quality.

Padel shoe prices vary depending on various factors. Having a budget can help you stay on the safe side to avoid overspending. However, don’t make your decision based on money or brand name alone.

## **Know Your Style of Play**

How you move on the pitch matters a lot when choosing padel shoes. Offensive players who like playing on the front foot need shoes with excellent traction and support. This will help minimize the chances of slipping up as you dart around the court.

Players who like taking a more defensive approach should focus on shoes with more cushioning. This type of shoe will help absorb the extra shock, preventing injuries and offering more stability.

Another thing worth noting is the playing surface. You cannot use clay court shoes on a grass court and vice versa. Ensure that the shoes have the best traction to prevent slipping. We recommend looking for padel footwear with a herringbone or multi-directional tread pattern.

## **Buy the Right Fit**

Identify your foot size before buying your padel shoes. Sometimes, the shoe size metrics may vary depending on location. So, don’t hesitate to seek help from a shop assistant if you have trouble finding your shoe size.

Try the shoes before purchase to ensure that they fit nicely and with the socks you will be wearing on the court. Jog in place or walk around to assess the shoes’ fit and comfort. Look for shoes with extra stability to control pronation if you over or underpronate.

## **Breathability and Durability**

Keeping dry feet during padel games can help prevent injuries. You also don’t want foot odor after the game. Go for shoes with mesh material on the top and sides as they help with airflow and keep your feet dry.

Also, inspect the shoes’ build quality. High-quality padel shoes can be expensive but are worth it in the long run. They will withstand your time on the court and can last a couple of years before wear and tear takes over.

## **Summing Up**

A good padel shoe can be a confidence and morale booster. Ensure that you do your due diligence to make an informed purchase. Also, don’t hesitate to ask for help when shopping from an online padel shop.
