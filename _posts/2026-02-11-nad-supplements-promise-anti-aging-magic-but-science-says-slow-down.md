Wellness influencers have found their latest obsession, and it comes in the form of NAD+ supplements. Scroll through any health-focused corner of social media and you'll find someone promising that these little pills can turn back the clock on aging. But before you click "add to cart," let's talk about what's actually happening here.

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, if you want to get technical) is a coenzyme that exists in every cell of your body. Dr. Konstantin Vasyukevich, a New York-based facial plastic surgeon, explains it as the thing that keeps "everything running smoothly." It creates energy, repairs DNA, and even helps regulate your sleep schedule. Pretty important stuff.

The problem is that NAD+ levels drop as we age. And that's where the supplement industry saw an opportunity.

## What Actually Happens When NAD+ Decreases

Your body isn't stupid. When NAD+ levels fall, you feel it. Tiredness creeps in, your skin starts showing its age, and your cells basically struggle to do their jobs as efficiently. This natural decline is real, which is why the supplement pitch sounds so appealing.

But here's where things get murky. Yes, NAD+ supplements can boost your levels. Yes, some studies (including one from 2023) suggest they support metabolism and weight management. Dr. Jonathan Jennings, a board-certified internist, notes that "most data suggests all versions are safe in most populations," but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement.

The [technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) behind these supplements varies wildly. You can take them as pills, nasal sprays, intramuscular injections, or even intravenously. Each method comes with its own side effect profile, and the FDA doesn't regulate supplements the way it does medications. So you're essentially flying blind unless you work closely with a doctor.

## The Side Effects Nobody Talks About

Here's what the Instagram posts don't mention: NAD+ supplements can mess with your stomach, make you dizzy, cause flushing, and totally screw up your sleep if you take them too late in the day. Not exactly the glamorous anti-aging routine you were sold.

Nayan Patel, a doctor of pharmacy and founder of Auro Wellness, points out that these supplements aren't appropriate for pregnant people, children, or those who are nursing. A 2020 study also showed potential problems for anyone with existing liver or kidney issues because of how the body metabolizes the supplement.

And if you're on other medications? Good luck figuring out if there's an interaction without professional guidance. The supplement world operates in a gray area where marketing often outpaces actual [science](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=science).

## The Truth About Reversing Aging

Let's be clear: NAD+ supplements are not a magic eraser for wrinkles or a pause button on aging. Vasyukevich is refreshingly honest about this. "They won't completely stop aging, but they could help your cells stay healthier and function better, which might slow things down a little."

That's not exactly what the wellness crowd wants to hear, but it's the reality. Some research shows benefits for skin appearance and energy levels, but Patel stresses that more clinical trials are "necessary" before anyone should be making big claims about aging prevention.

What really gets me is when these supplements are positioned as a replacement for basic health habits. You know what actually works? Regular exercise, decent sleep, managing stress, and eating foods rich in vitamin B3 like chicken, turkey, tuna, and mushrooms. Shocking, I know.

## Better Ways To Boost NAD+ Levels

If you're serious about maintaining NAD+ levels, there are approaches that don't involve dropping money on supplements of questionable quality. Vasyukevich mentions that "regular exercise, intermittent fasting or even cutting back on calories can naturally increase NAD+ in your body."

Your body can convert vitamin B3 into NAD+, so foods rich in niacin and vitamin B3 actually help. We're talking about real food: avocados, peanuts, green peas, beef, fish. The stuff that's been around forever and doesn't need an influencer code for 10% off.

Exercise particularly seems to stimulate the production of NAD+ precursors naturally. So maybe before you invest in expensive supplements, invest in a gym membership or just start walking more. Revolutionary concept, I know.

## The Research Gap Is Real

Here's the uncomfortable part: we're still in the early stages of understanding how NAD+ supplementation really works long-term. A 2023 study on nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NAD+ precursors) showed some improvements in cardiovascular, metabolic, and physical function, but the research involved different doses over varying periods. The findings are interesting but hardly conclusive.

Patel tells it straight: these supplements should be approached "with caution." That's doctor-speak for "we don't really know everything yet, so don't go overboard." The [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) of supplements thrives on hype, but the science moves at its own pace.

And that pace is slow. Frustratingly slow if you're someone hoping for a quick fix to aging.

## Who's Actually Making Money Here

Let's not dance around it. The supplement industry is built on hope and marketing, not always on solid evidence. NAD+ supplements can cost anywhere from $30 to several hundred dollars a month depending on the form and brand. IV infusions? Even more expensive.

Patel warns that not all supplements are created equal, and it's important to pick high-quality options. But how do you know what's high-quality when there's no regulatory oversight? You basically have to trust the manufacturer's word, and that's a leap of faith many people are taking with their wallets and their health.

The whole thing feels like we're being sold a solution to a problem that might be better addressed through lifestyle changes that don't come with a subscription fee. But lifestyle changes don't have the same sexy marketing angle as a pill that promises to reverse aging, and that's probably why your feed is full of NAD+ ads instead of reminders to eat more vegetables and get better sleep.
