Samsung just sent out invites for its Galaxy Unpacked event on February 25 in San Francisco, and we're gearing up for the Galaxy S26 series reveal. The company is doing its usual song and dance about AI features being "seamlessly integrated," which at this point feels like every tech company's mandatory talking point for 2026.

But here's something actually interesting: Samsung is teasing a privacy display feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra that lets you hide parts of your screen from nosy people around you. Think of it as a selective privacy shield where you can hide your notification area or other sensitive bits when you're using your phone in public. It's a clever idea in our oversharing world, though I'm curious how well it actually works in practice versus how cool it sounds in a press release.

## The Chip Situation Nobody Wants to Talk About

Let's address the elephant in the room. The S26 lineup will reportedly run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China, while everyone else gets Samsung's own Exynos 2600. This two-tier system has been annoying customers for years, and while Samsung claims the gap is narrowing, it's still frustrating that where you live determines which version of a flagship phone you get.

The <a href="https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology">Technology</a> community has been vocal about this for ages. Snapdragon chips have consistently outperformed Exynos processors in benchmarks and thermal management. Sure, maybe the difference is getting smaller, but "less bad" isn't exactly the rallying cry Samsung should be going for with phones that cost over a thousand bucks.

## Battery Life and the Earbuds Nobody Asked For

SamMobile reports the S26 will pack a 5,100 mAh battery with 60W wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Those are solid specs, nothing revolutionary but competent enough for a 2026 flagship. The charging speeds are still behind some Chinese manufacturers who've been pushing 100W+ charging for a while now, but Samsung has always been more conservative here.

Samsung's also planning to drop updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. Apparently they're redesigning them because the previous generation looked too much like AirPods. It's kind of funny that even Samsung couldn't resist the AirPods aesthetic until people started calling them out on it.

## The Pre-Order Carrot

Samsung is dangling a $30 promotional credit for anyone who pre-registers interest, which jumps to $150 if you actually pre-order one of the devices. No trade-in required for that $150, which is honestly a decent offer. Pre-registering doesn't commit you to anything either, so it's basically free money toward Samsung products even if you decide the S26 isn't worth it.

The event kicks off at 10 AM PT on February 25, streaming live on Samsung's website and YouTube channel. Expect the usual polished presentation about how AI will change your life and make your morning coffee taste better or whatever they're promising these days.

What's really interesting is how much of this feels incremental rather than revolutionary, with <a href="https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business">Business</a> pressures pushing annual releases even when there's not much groundbreaking to show. The privacy display feature might be the most genuinely useful addition here, assuming it works as advertised and doesn't drain your battery trying to selectively hide parts of your screen from specific viewing angles.
