`Tuning : Half (1/2) Step Down |d# A# F# C# G# D#|`

`- if you wanna play this Song on Standard |eBGDAE| Tuning,`

```
then play these Chords :
```

`G#m (Instead of Am) . B (Instead of C) . E (Instead of F) . F# (Instead of G) . D# (Instead of E)`

`- I'm playing with (1/2) Half Step Down.`

`INTRO : x2`

`Am . G.C . F . C`

```
G . Am . F . G
```

`VERSE`

`Am      G   C`

```
Maybe I'm wrong
```

`F               C`

```
Or maybe I'm right
```

`E            Am                       F                     G`

```
Maybe it's just too late but this is keeping me awake all night.
```

```
Am    G    C
```

```
Maybe say yes
```

`F             C`

```
Or maybe say no
```

```
E            Am              F                       G
```

```
Maybe I'm just too shy to admit that it is time to go.
```

`CHORUS`

```
Am  G    C
```

```
We go out on our own
```

```
F                C
```

```
It's a big bad world outside
```

```
G                        Am
```

```
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
```

```
F                       G
```

```
Trying to make it all worthwhile.
```

`VERSE`

`Am   G   C`

```
Maybe believe
```

`F               C`

```
Or maybe don't care
```

`E                  Am               F                     G`

```
Sure, maybe there is no god in the big white clouds up there
```

`Am   G      C`

```
Maybe live long
```

`F             C`

```
Or maybe die young
```

`E               Am                      F                  G`

```
Or maybe live every day like it's your last day under the sun.
```

`CHORUS`

```
Am  G   C
```

```
We go out on our own
```

```
F                C
```

```
It's a big bad world outside
```

```
G                        Am
```

```
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
```

```
F                       G
```

```
Trying to make it all worthwhile.
```

```
Am  G   C
```

```
We go out on our own
```

```
F                C
```

```
It's a big bad world outside
```

```
G                        Am
```

```
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
```

```
F                       G
```

```
Try to make it all feel right
```

`This Part : x2`

`(Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.....)`
`Am . G.C . F . G`
`Am . G.C . G`

`CHORUS`

```
Am  G   C
```

```
We go out on our own
```

```
F                C
```

```
It's a big bad world outside
```

```
G                        Am
```

```
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
```

```
F                       G
```

```
Trying to make it all worthwhile.
```

```
Am  G   C
```

```
We go out on our own
```

```
F                C
```

```
It's a big bad world outside
```

```
G                        Am
```

```
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
```

```
F                       G
```

```
Trying to make it all worthwhile.
