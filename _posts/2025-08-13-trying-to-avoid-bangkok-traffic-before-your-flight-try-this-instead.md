In case you want to avoid being caught in the notorious traffic in Bangkok, the straightforward answer is not to leave early - it is to book a room in one of the [hotels near Bangkok airport](https://novotelbangkokfutureparkrangsit.com/hotel-near-don-muang-airport/) for the night before. Given a choice between a restful night at the airport or staving off flight cancellation and unwinding on the last day in Thailand, why not choose the former?

## Why Staying Near the Airport Makes Sense

Bangkok is scarcely predictable with traffic, especially concerning rush hour and downpours. Even if you add in buffers for time, the delays can stack up fast if a small hiccup takes place. Thus, staying beside Suvarnabhumi Airport the night before your flight would avoid:

-   Long, stressful taxi rides during [peak traffic](https://www.doh.go.th/uploads/files/Exec_Summary_EN.pdf)

-   The fear of arriving late for check-in

-   The cost of last-minute transportation options

More importantly, it gives you breathing room. You'll wake up, have a relaxed breakfast, and reach the terminal in minutes.

## What to Do Near the Airport

The proximity of the airport does not mean you are forever confined to cement and terminals. The area surrounding the Suvarnabhumi airport provides a variety of ways and various activities to kill time before finally it is time to board a plane and say goodbye.

## Explore Local Markets

The very nearby Paseo Mall offers shops, street food, and cafés for yet another final taste of Bangkok. Talad Rot Fai Srinakarin (Train Night Market) should be good for late-night running if you will be flying out late the next day.

## Relax Before You Go

Think of all those foot massages or [Thai spa sessions](https://infeeds.com/the-best-wellness-activities-to-enjoy-in-thailand/); many are minutes away from the airport. It's little things such as a café or rooftop bar that allow you to sit back and pen down entries of your trip, view pictures, or grab last presents. 

## Travel Tips to Maximise Your Stay

Keep everything smooth before your flight with these tips:

-   Avoid that last-minute jolt by confirming your terminal and departure gate in advance.

-   Transport to the airport should be prebooked, especially so if your hotel doesn't offer a shuttle.

-   Essentials should be packed so that you don't have to run around at the last minute in the morning.

-   Spare some time for VAT refunds or duty-free shopping if applicable.

## Skip the Stress, Not the Experience

With just a little organisation, an airport stay can smooth over the end of your Thai adventure or even serve as a light in the long tunnel of travel. Markets that'll hurry you from busy days to mellow evenings are just charming enough to set the mood before your tiresome flight.

Whether you're heading home or off to your next destination, wrapping up your trip with ease can make all the difference.

## Make Your Exit Memorable

Avoid the chaos, skip the panic, and give yourself the gift of a stress-free departure. Book airport accommodations for your last night in Bangkok; it is one small decision that will go a long way in elevating your complete travel experience.
