Fly fishing is unique because it blends elements of sport, skill and leisure by many people. While many enjoy it as a peaceful escape, it's also considered a sport because it requires precision, technique, and physical effort. Whether you are competing or casting for enjoyment, the sunglasses you use play a critical role in the experience.

### Why Fly Fishing Is Considered a Sport

The main reason why it is referred to as a sport is that it is skill-based. That said, it requires practice and precision. You will need to cast a lightweight fly line, choose the right fly pattern, and read the water and fish behavior.

Fly fishing also involves mental and physical activities that can take hours of wading, hiking to remote rivers, and mental focus to catch elusive fish, such as salmon or trout. There are also fly-fishing competitions and international championships organized by governing bodies.

### Specialized Gear Used for Fly Fishing

-   Fly rod -- Lightweight and flexible, built to cast fly lines instead of bait.

-   Fly reel -- Holds the fly line and backing; should be well-balanced with the rod.

-   Fly line -- Heavier than standard fishing line; available in floating, sinking, or sink-tip varieties depending on water conditions and target fish.

-   Waterproof trousers and boots -- Important for wading in rivers or streams.

-   Vest or sling pack -- Useful for carrying flies, tools, snacks, and other essentials.

-   Polarized sunglasses -- Reduce surface glare and help spot fish below the waterline.

### Why Use Polarized Sunglasses for Fly Fishing

When you use polarized lenses, you will notice that it can cut surface glare so you can see fish and underwater structures a lot easier. The best colors or tints to enhance the contrast in low to moderate light are amber, brown, and copper. You may also select yellow or gold for low-light or overcast days.
