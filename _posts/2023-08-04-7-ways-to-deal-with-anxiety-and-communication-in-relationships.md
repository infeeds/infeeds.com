I statements allow a person to express their needs and feelings in a non-aggressive way. They can help open conversations for dialogue between partners and allow them to discuss their anxieties and feelings in the relationship.

For example, a person could say “I feel anxious when you are late for appointments,” rather than making an accusatory statement such as “you are always late.” This type of statement focuses on the speaker’s feelings and needs without putting the other person on the defensive.

It can also help partners set boundaries and resolve issues in a healthy way. Learning to use I statements effectively can help build trust and understanding in a relationship.

To tackle these issues effectively, it is important to open up to your partner about your feelings and express any anxieties in a calm and understanding manner. This approach will allow each partner to better understand and comprehend the other’s emotions and needs.

Furthermore, it is important to make time for each other and to practice activities together. Seek activities that help reduce the stress and anxiety that can impede a relationship. Moreover, it is essential to be supportive and there for each other. Make sure to provide reassurances when needed.

Remember to treat your partner with respect and kindness. Ask their opinion in times of stress as this can make a huge difference in reducing tension and promoting communication. Spend time partaking in activities you both enjoy to build a strong connection and foster a trusting relationship.

## **6. Set Boundaries**

Boundaries can provide a sense of structure and safety in a relationship. This helps both individuals feel more secure. Establishing boundaries will not only help reduce relationship anxiety. It will also provide the necessary space needed for communication to be effective.

Listening to each other’s feelings and respecting each other’s boundaries is an essential part of dealing with anxiety and communication within a relationship. Having a good balance of rules and understanding will keep both parties safe and secure.

It can also help us be aware of when we are feeling anxious in the relationship. That way, we can take proactive steps to address any issues that are causing distress. Mindfulness can also help us identify our triggers and better cope with them.
