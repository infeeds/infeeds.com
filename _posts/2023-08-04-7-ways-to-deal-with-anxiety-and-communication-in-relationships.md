But there may be ways to deal with those stressors that are easier and healthier than breaking up!

Keep reading to learn more about how to resolve anxieties within relationships and how to strengthen your bond and outlook on your partnership.

## **1. Practice Active Listening**

To practice active listening, it is important to recognize [body language](https://www.verywellmind.com/understand-body-language-and-facial-expressions-4147228), reflect on emotions expressed, and summarize what has been said.

## **2. Seek Help from a Marriage Helper**

Seeking help from a marriage helper can be beneficial to couples trying to build a stronger bond and reestablish trust. A marriage helper can provide couples with tools to use when discussing issues related to anxiety, such as helping to create a safe space for communication.

## **3. Use “I” Statements**

I statements allow a person to express their needs and feelings in a non-aggressive way. They can help open conversations for dialogue between partners and allow them to discuss their anxieties and feelings in the relationship.

For example, a person could say “I feel anxious when you are late for appointments,” rather than making an accusatory statement such as “you are always late.” This type of statement focuses on the speaker’s feelings and needs without putting the other person on the defensive.

It can also help partners set boundaries and resolve issues in a healthy way. Learning to use I statements effectively can help build trust and understanding in a relationship.

## **4. Practice Empathy**

Empathy enables both parties to effectively process the issue at hand. It helps both think from the other’s perspective to arrive at a resolution. Empathy as well involves actively listening to and deeply understanding your partner’s:

- feelings
- struggles
- motivations

Practicing empathy also helps identify possible causes of anxiety, while also allowing us to be compassionate. It teaches us to view our partner’s thoughts and feelings without judgment or criticism.

Being empathetic, understanding, and supportive of each other can make a big difference in the long run. This is when it comes to addressing moments of anxiety and communication in relationships.

## **5. Manage Anxiety Together**

To tackle these issues effectively, it is important to open up to your partner about your feelings and express any anxieties in a calm and understanding manner. This approach will allow each partner to better understand and comprehend the other’s emotions and needs.

Furthermore, it is important to make time for each other and to practice activities together. Seek activities that help reduce the stress and anxiety that can impede a relationship. Moreover, it is essential to be supportive and there for each other. Make sure to provide reassurances when needed.

Remember to treat your partner with respect and kindness. Ask their opinion in times of stress as this can make a huge difference in reducing tension and promoting communication. Spend time partaking in activities you both enjoy to build a strong connection and foster a trusting relationship.

## **6. Set Boundaries**

Boundaries can provide a sense of structure and safety in a relationship. This helps both individuals feel more secure. Establishing boundaries will not only help reduce relationship anxiety. It will also provide the necessary space needed for communication to be effective.

Effective communication is key in a relationship especially when it comes to discussing boundaries and any anxieties that may be present. This helps both individuals to stay open and honest with each other. It also encourages each to speak directly to any issues at hand.

Listening to each other’s feelings and respecting each other’s boundaries is an essential part of dealing with anxiety and communication within a relationship. Having a good balance of rules and understanding will keep both parties safe and secure.

## **7. Practice Mindfulness**

Practicing mindfulness helps us to pay attention to the present moment. It also helps to nonjudgmentally acknowledge our thoughts and feelings. This can help us better understand our anxiety and how it affects our communication.

It can also help us be aware of when we are feeling anxious in the relationship. That way, we can take proactive steps to address any issues that are causing distress. Mindfulness can also help us identify our triggers and better cope with them.

Lastly, it can help improve our connection with our partners. This is achieved by enabling us to be more mindful of their thoughts and feelings, allowing us to better communicate with each other.
