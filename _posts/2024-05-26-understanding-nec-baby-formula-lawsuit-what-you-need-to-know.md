An explosive lawsuit alleges that a major baby formula manufacturer’s negligence led to a rare but devastating disease striking premature infants with deadly consequences. The legal battle could have far-reaching impacts on an industry that provides crucial nourishment to society’s most vulnerable. In this article, we will highlight the details of the NEC baby formula lawsuit.

## What Is NEC and Why Is It Linked to Baby Formula?

Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe bacterial infection that affects the intestines of newborns. It’s a life-threatening condition often necessitating emergency surgery.

NEC happens when harmful bacteria invade an infant’s intestinal walls, leading to inflammation, pain, and tissue death. This can result in dangerous holes in the intestines, allowing bacteria to leak into the abdomen potentially causing systemic infection.

Premature babies, particularly those weighing under 1,500 grams, are at the highest risk for NEC, affecting around [10% of them](https://www.birthinjuryhelpcenter.org/nec.html). However, full-term or near-term infants can also be impacted, and formula-fed babies have a higher likelihood of developing NEC.

Recent research suggests that cow’s milk-based infant formulas significantly increase NEC risk in preterm infants. According to this paper, a study found that babies exclusively fed human milk were 90% less likely to undergo surgical NEC than those given cow’s milk products.

According to a 2011 U.S. Surgeon General report, premature infants not breastfed had a 138% higher chance of developing NEC.

In another study comparing two randomized trials of formulas for very low birth weight preterm infants, it was discovered that an exclusive human milk diet greatly reduced NEC incidence compared to cow’s milk-based formulas.

Although cow’s milk formulas provided consistent nutrition, they raised risks of NEC and death. The study also highlighted the substantial healthcare costs associated with treating NEC, ranging from $180,000 to over $300,000 per infant, depending on whether surgery was necessary.

## Lawsuits Target Major Formula Brands Over NEC Risks in Premature Infants

Similac and Enfamil are two common brands of cow’s milk-based infant formulas. Both manufacturers offer product lines tailored for premature babies with different supplement levels.

Despite this health risk, the potential dangers have not always been prominently displayed on packaging or marketing materials by formula companies.

Some parents have filed the [NEC baby formula lawsuit](https://www.torhoermanlaw.com/toxic-baby-formula-nec-lawsuit/) against Abbott (Similac) and Mead Johnson (Enfamil), alleging their premature infants developed the disease from being fed these cow’s milk formulas.

According to TorHoerman Law, in May 2021, a Louisiana woman sued the companies in Illinois, claiming her son, who was born prematurely in 2002, was fed their formulas and required intestinal surgery for NEC with long-term health impacts.

The suit accused the formula makers of negligent marketing by “targeting” parents of preemies without properly conveying the NEC risks associated with their cow’s milk products.

Where the formula has been linked to a preemie’s NEC case, legal action may be pursued to seek compensation for injuries and medical costs resulting from the disease. Proving causation can be challenging but is central to these types of product liability lawsuits.

## Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition Authorizes Voluntary Recall of Enfamil Nutramigen Baby Formula

Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition has voluntarily recalled select batches of its Enfamil Nutramigen baby formula powder. This hypoallergenic formula is designed for babies with cow’s milk allergies.

The recalled batches were produced in June 2023 and come in [12.6-ounce](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/parenting/features/enfamil-baby-formula-nutramigen-recall-1-2-2024) and 19.8-ounce containers. Most of the recalled formula would have been purchased by consumers between June and August 2023.

This recall comes at a difficult time, as baby formula shortages have occurred consistently over the past few years. However, the recall is expected to have a limited impact as it affects a small number of batches from earlier this year.

While testing by the company did not find any bacterial contamination, the recall was initiated out of an abundance of caution. There is a potential risk of Cronobacter sakazakii contamination, a bacteria that can cause serious infections in infants.

So far, no illnesses have been reported related to the recalled batches. As most would have already been used, anyone still having the recalled formula should discard it. Only certain batch numbers of the powdered Nutramigen formula are affected. Other Reckitt/Mead Johnson products are not part of this recall.

## FAQs

### 1. Do I qualify for an NEC lawsuit?

A: You may be eligible to pursue legal action if your child developed Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) after consuming cow’s milk-based infant formula products. These products are manufactured by companies like Similac or Enfamil, which have been linked to an increased risk of this condition.

### 2. Do babies with NEC poop?

A: In some cases, when a baby is diagnosed with NEC, the medical team may create a temporary opening called an ostomy on the baby’s abdomen. This allows the intestines to rest and heal while the baby can still pass stool through the ostomy into a specialized pouch or bag.

### 3. Do babies with NEC survive?

A: Unfortunately, NEC can be a severe and life-threatening condition for some infants. Despite medical interventions, many babies diagnosed with NEC may not survive due to the severity of the illness or complications. It is essential to have open discussions with the healthcare professionals involved in your baby’s care to understand the potential risks and concerns associated with NEC and its treatment.

In conclusion, the NEC baby formula lawsuits highlight the ongoing need for vigilance and transparency in the infant formula industry. While these products provide essential nourishment for countless babies, the potential risks must be carefully evaluated and communicated, particularly for vulnerable premature infants.

Pursuing justice through legal channels underscores the importance of prioritizing the well-being and safety of these fragile lives. As researchers continue to unravel the intricate relationship between infant nutrition and devastating conditions like NEC, it is imperative that manufacturers, healthcare providers, and parents remain committed. They must make informed decisions, and these decisions should prioritize the health of babies above all else.
