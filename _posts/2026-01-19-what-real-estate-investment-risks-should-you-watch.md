Before you commit your money to [Thailand property investment for foreigners​](https://nebuworld.com/) and other real estate assets, you should know the risks you're likely to encounter. Like many investment vehicles, real estate is not risk-free. But any challenges you come across are avoidable and manageable with the right knowledge.

## **Market Risk** 

You've heard it before: the real estate market can go up, down, and even crash. So, if you're looking at real estate as a [new avenue for wealth creation](https://infeeds.com/the-entrepreneurial-spirit-finding-new-avenues-for-wealth-creation/), you should first study the market conditions. 

* Stay up to date on the current real estate cycle, whether it's a buyer's or seller's market. Add more properties to your real estate portfolio during a buyer's market, and cash in on those properties during a seller's market.  
* Adjust your investment strategies based on the current situation. The real estate market in Thailand currently has over 400,000 unsold condos, something you should consider before you make your next move.   
* Always play the long game when it comes to property investment. Allow your property’s value to grow over time.  
* Diversify into different areas and different property types. Don’t limit yourself to one location or geography. Mix residential properties with commercial, industrial, and retail properties. This will help divide and spread the risks. 

## **Property Risks** 

You can maximise profit from a property for as long as it remains in good condition. But nature can have other plans, and human errors contribute to property risks as well.

* Have properties checked thoroughly by a reputable inspector before you buy them.   
* Make sure it sits in a good neighbourhood with little to no risk of flooding or fire.   
* Insure the property with the right coverage so you don't have to pay out of pocket if it's damaged or destroyed.   
* If you're renting it out, take out landlord insurance and protect the property from bad tenants. 

## **Location Risks** 

As a [global health hub](https://thailand.go.th/issue-focus-detail/thailanda-global-health-hub), buying a property in Thailand is highly desirable for anyone who wants access to quality health care. Not all regions and cities are created equal, however.

* Always check a location's value and desirability before you invest in any of the properties within it.   
* Depending on your target market, some of the factors you may need to consider are crime rate, healthcare access, school quality, and transportation.   
* Consider investing in developing areas where entry prices are still low, and the potential for higher income grows as development continues. They're also the best option for long-term capital gains. 

## **Financing and Interest Rate Risks** 

Don't be that investor who focuses only on returns and overestimates or underestimates financing and maintenance costs.

* Make sure to accurately calculate all expenses incurred in buying and renting out a property to avoid negative cash flow.  
* Avoid risks related to increasing or varied interest rates, as well as loans with adjustable-rate mortgages or balloon payments.   
* Skip anything but prepayments to avoid penalties and late fees.

If you're a foreigner investing in Thai properties, you also need to learn to manage the currency dynamics and understand the local real estate market to better protect yourself from any form of risk. If ROI and capital growth are two of your main investment goals, Nebu Residences can help you achieve both.
