Tuning : STANDARD |EADGBe|

CHORDS : A . D . E . F#m . Bm

INTRO

 A . D . E . F#m . D

VERSE

A               D        E      F#m  D
 I don't really say this that often
A                               D      E      F#m  D
 But there's something that the papers forgot
A             D        E          F#m
 Every time I read them, I know I feed them
      D     A                          D        E      F#m  D
 But I know, they're painting but they can't leave a mark
A                   D          E     F#m  D
 Because my friends don't read the papers
A                      D       E       F#m        D
 And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
A                D        E          F#m 
 So every time I read them, I know I feed them
      D     A                  D       E      F#m  D
 But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

CHORUS

F#m         Bm
 You don't know me
           E                 A
 Don't you think that I get lonely?
         F#m              Bm
 It gets dark inside my head
          E                  A
 Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me
F#m         Bm
 If you're lonely
           E                     A
 Don't you think you're on your own
         F#m              Bm
 It gets dark inside my head
          E                  A
 Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me

VERSE

A             D       E        F#m  D
 Say it to my face if you mean it
A             D         E      F#m  D
 Say it to my face, but you won't
A               D
 I know I'm not losing
E        F#m         D
 But I'm losing my mi-ind
A             D         E         F#m  D
 Does anybody know what that's like?

CHORUS

F#m         Bm
 You don't know me
           E                 A
 Don't you think that I get lonely?
         F#m              Bm
 It gets dark inside my head
          E                  A
 Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me
F#m         Bm
 If you're lonely
           E                     A
 Don't you think you're on your own
         F#m              Bm
 It gets dark inside my head
          E                  A
 Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me

Repeat the same process for CHORUS.
