A majority of people buy based on the brand name or logo on an item of clothing. Companies spend billions of dollars protecting their brand image to ensure their customers are getting the real deal – not fakes or also known as counterfeits. Unfortunately, the market for knock offs is thriving thanks to improved copycat techniques and production methods, and many labels are experiencing financial problems due to this. One of these companies is Thrasher.

We all know how frustrating it is to get a brand new shirt, put it on and go out with friends to have one guy from the group saying: “Man, why are you wearing a fake?”. It is not your fault, and you should not feel embarrassed about it. We have seen many counterfeits over the decades, and they keep getting better and better. Still, there are a few things you should look out for when purchasing a branded item, and in this article, we will try to pinpoint them. Enjoy!

## **Stitching**

If an item is authentic, the stitching appears much cleaner than is duped counterparts. Original Thrasher shirts and hoodies usually have one straight line of sewing while the fakes usually come with more wavy-looking lines, which are also often unsightly or make edges pop-up. The authentic products’ stitching also contains more stitches per square inch. Also on the hoods, the originals do not have stitches on the sides, or the top, while fakes usually come with stitches all over the mantle. Another thing to look for is the sides of the garment. If it has stitches on both sides, then the model is most likely to be a counterfeit.

## **Fabric**

The fabric of the original feels weighted and of finer quality. Fakes are usually noticeably lighter than the authentic models. The original does not have pulls or rips in it, neither should the colors fade. Another thing to pay attention to is the strings. The materials used for counterfeits are usually synthetics, not real cotton, meaning that the strings will look poorly knitted and rough, and the ends will not have perfectly sealed edges.

## **Logo**

The most obvious difference between the authentic and the counterfeit is the logo design. The logos on the original thrasher clothing designs look perfect; no details are missing neither are the icons blurry. Every edge is perfectly cut. Fake models might even contain spelling errors. The easiest way to tell a fake from the original when purchasing the iconic flame design is the number of colors in the logo. The original has yellow, orange, and red, while the fake does not contain any orange at all.

## **Label**

The item you buy should have the iconic Thrasher clothing’ black label saying “Thrasher – Live to Skate – Skate or Die” San Francisco embroidered with white thread. Beneath, you will find another label of the brand authorized to distribute the model. Do not worry if two items do not have the same label as Thrasher is not a clothing brand and uses various distributors to supply its products to the market. However, note that all labels should only be written in English.
