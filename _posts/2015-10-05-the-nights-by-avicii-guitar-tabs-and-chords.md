TUNING : STANDARD [eBGDAE]

CAPO : 6th Fret

VERSE :

     Am 
Hey, once upon a younger year
```

```
When all our shadows disappeared
```

```
G                          Am
The animals inside came out to play
```

```
Am
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
```

```
Learned our lessons through the tears
```

```
G                            Am
Made memories we knew would never fade
```

```
Pre-Chorus :

          F          
One day my father—he told me,
```

```
C
"Son, don't let it slip away."
```

```
G                                Am
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
```

```
F
"When you get older
```

```
C
Your wild heart will live for younger days
```

```
G
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
```

```
CHORUS :

              F                             C
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
```

```
G               Am
So live a life you will remember."
```

```
F                         C
My father told me when I was just a child
```

```
G                 Am
These are the nights that never die
```

```
My father told me
