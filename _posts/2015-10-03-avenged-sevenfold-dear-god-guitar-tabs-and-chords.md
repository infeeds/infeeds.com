Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

When I'm much too far away

There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
```

```
C9                     G
```

```
There's no one here while the city sleeps
```

```
D
```

```
And all the shops are closed
```

`G                 D            Em                  Bm`

Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

Some search, never finding a way

```
Before long, they waste away
```

`Em        D7  C                      G  D9`

I found you, something told me to stay

```
I gave in, to selfish ways

And how I miss someone to hold
```

```
When hope begins to fade...
