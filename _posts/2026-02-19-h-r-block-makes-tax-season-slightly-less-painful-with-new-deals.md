Death and taxes. That old saying exists for a reason, and we're rapidly approaching that dreaded April 15 deadline. If you're like most people, you've been putting off thinking about your taxes for as long as humanly possible. I get it. Nobody wakes up excited to dig through receipts and calculate deductions.

H&R Block has been in the tax game for seven decades now, which is longer than most of us have been alive. They've built their reputation on making this annual nightmare slightly more bearable, whether that's through their traditional office visits or their online [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) platforms that let you file from your couch.

Right now they're offering $50 off if you go the in-person route with one of their tax professionals. The catch? You need to book an appointment and use their coupon system before February 23. Each coupon has a single-use code, so you'll need to grab a fresh one from their site. They're also running a 25% discount on their DIY online service through the same date.

## The Free Option Actually Exists

Here's something most people don't realize: more than half of tax filers actually qualify for H&R Block's completely free online edition. If your taxes are straightforward (just a basic 1040 without complicated schedules), you can file both federal and state returns without paying a cent.

The free tier works if you're claiming standard stuff like the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, student loan interest, or retirement distributions. It's not going to handle your [Business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) expenses or investment portfolios, but for simple returns it does the job.

## When You Need Actual Human Help

Let's be honest, tax software can only take you so far. Sometimes you just need to talk to someone who knows what they're doing. H&R Block offers several ways to work with actual tax professionals, from traditional office appointments to virtual consultations where you never have to change out of your sweatpants.

They also have this thing called a Second Look Review where they'll go back through your last three years of returns hunting for missed deductions or errors. It's free, which seems almost too good to be true, but apparently they're confident enough in finding money you left on the table that it's worth offering.

## The Refund Advance Situation

If waiting weeks for your refund sounds unbearable, H&R Block will loan you up to $4,000 immediately after filing. No interest, no loan fees, just instant cash. The deadline for this is March 15, and you have to file with one of their tax pros to qualify.

I'm not usually one to recommend advance loans of any kind, but at least this one doesn't come with predatory interest rates like some sketchy alternatives out there.

## Pricing Tiers That Actually Make Sense

The tiered pricing structure is pretty straightforward. Free is free. Deluxe runs $28 federal plus $37 per state if you need itemized deductions. Premium is $56 federal (same state fee) for investment income. Self-employed folks are looking at $68 federal because their [finances](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) are inevitably more complicated with all those 1099 forms.

All the paid tiers include a free review from a tax professional, which is useful if you want someone to double-check your work before hitting submit. They're currently offering 20% off their software products through April 15, and you don't need a promo code for that one.

## The Activation Code Mystery

If you buy the desktop software, you'll get this ten-character activation code that unlocks your five free federal e-files. It's just uppercase letters and numbers strung together. Keep track of it because you'll need it to actually use the software you just paid for.

Filing taxes will never be fun, no matter how many discounts companies throw at us, but at least the tools keep getting better and the process slightly less miserable each year.
