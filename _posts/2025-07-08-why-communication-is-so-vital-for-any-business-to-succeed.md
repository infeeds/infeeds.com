The world is seemingly getting smaller by the day, as contact can be made instantly virtually anywhere through various means. The mystique of escaping for a break that nobody has heard of is nigh on impossible, as someone is likely to have been there, or locals post photos and videos online of it. However, there are also massive advantages. OK, postcards home might be a thing of the past, but instant communication certainly has its advantages, especially in emergencies.

Businesses have certainly learned to adapt and take advantage of the many options available to them, something that was necessary during the lockdown period a few years ago. What those times unveiled was that it is possible to work remotely or hold conference video calls so that everyone remains up to speed. However, to make the most of it requires the best equipment, such as a [Cisco system phone](https://www.telex.com.au/cisco-webex/webex-calling). Here we look at the massive advantages in communication of using Webex calling.

Cisco Webex Calling is the best way to combine voice, video, and messaging, so that meetings can be held on a single cloud-based platform. Having a system that streamlines and integrates internal and external communication improves productivity and ease of use, offering massive advantages, not least being able to schedule meetings at shorter notice, with travel not being an obstacle. It allows employees to make and receive business calls from anywhere using their desk phone, mobile device, or computer, ideal for remote work and those wanting to create hybrid teams. The phone system offers an ultimate business communication tool that streamlines and optimises any business operations, increasing productivity and reliability. It can assist when providing the secrets to putting together [engaging business presentations](https://infeeds.com/the-secret-to-engaging-business-presentations/).

Not every business has the budget and spare finances to purchase something that can cause them financial issues. Choosing a phone system which is scalable and can be subscribed to can help them with planning, meaning that they only pay for what they use and can easily be added to, or users can be removed as needed. Having a system with outstanding features like call forwarding, voicemail to email, call queues, and analytics ensures that communication moves up to a new level, with any organisation being able to manage calls professionally and efficiently, while adhering to [small business cybersecurity advice](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cybersecurity).

The increased efficiency is possible as Webex can be fully integrated with existing tools such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. This allows teams to work more efficiently without switching platforms, while providing a cost-saving. Ensuring that communication and calls remain secure and reliable is most important, which is guaranteed when using a system that benefits from robust end-to-end encryption, creating peace of mind for managers and clients alike. The experience of customers is also improved, with businesses being able to handle customer inquiries quickly and professionally.

Modern businesses that seek continual improvement are advised to use a quality communication tool, such as a Cisco system phone, for quality Webex calls and additional features to improve productivity.
