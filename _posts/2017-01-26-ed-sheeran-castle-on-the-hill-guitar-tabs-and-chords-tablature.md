VERSE

C                      F                 Am   G
 When I was six years old I broke my leg
```

```
C                  F                Am         G
 I was running from my brother and his friends
```

```
C                 F                   Am                 G
 And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
C                F
```

```
I was younger then, 
Am                G
```

```
Take me back to when...

SEMI-CHORUS

F             G                  C
```

```
I found my heart and broke it here
```

```
F
 Made friends and lost them through the years
```

```
F              G                  C
 And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
```

```
F 
I know I've grown
```

```
F               G
 And I can't wait to go home

CHORUS

C          F
```
`I'm on my way`

```
Am         G          C            F
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
```

```
Am           G    
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
```

```
C           F
And I miss the way
```

```
Am
You make me feel,
G
```

```
And it's real
```

```
C                F    Am        G
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

VERSE

C               F                Am                  G
```

```
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
```

```
C                     F                         Am                      G
 Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
```

```
C              F                Am  
 Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
```

```
G
 I don't reckon that I did it right
C                    F
```

```
But I was younger then,
```

```
Am                G
 Take me back to when...

SEMI-CHORUS

        F          G                 C
```
`We found weekend jobs, when we got paid`

```
F
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
```

```
F             G                    C 
 Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long,
```

```
F
 Oh, how we've grown
```

```
F              G
 But I can't wait to go home

CHORUS

C          F
```
`I'm on my way`

```
Am         G         C             F
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
```

```
Am           G
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
```

```
C           F
And I miss the way
```

```
Am
You make me feel,
```

```
G
 And it's real
```

```
C               F     Am        G
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
```

C . F
Am        G
Over the castle on the hill
```

Am        G
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
```

```
Am          G
 One works down by the coast
```

```
C             F 
 One had two kids but lives alone
```

```
Am       G
 One's brother overdosed
```

```
C          F
 One's already on his second wife
```

```
Am           G
 One's just barely getting by
```

```
C                   F
 But these people raised me

 And I can't wait to go home

Am        G             C            F
I still remember these old country lanes
```

```
Am           G
When we did not know the answers
```

```
C           F
And I miss the way
```

```
Am
You make me feel,
```

```

 It's real

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
