For this reason, it is something that can be added to or included in a substantial number of other IT roles and professions. From professional competitive gamers to international bankers and financiers they all need cyber protection for the various tasks and activities that they perform online and as long as you know what the risk points are, you have a head start in understanding how to implement cogent cyber security in these sectors.
