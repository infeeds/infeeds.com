In operant conditioning, behaviour is influenced by either reinforcement (reward) or punishment, leading to adjustments in the frequency or nature of that behaviour. The stimulus that accompanies this behaviour/consequence relationship starts to play a key role in driving these behaviour changes.

### Observational Learning: Gaining Knowledge by Watching Others

Observational learning occurs when individuals learn by watching the actions of others. This type of social learning doesn't always require direct reinforcement but instead depends on having a model, such as a parent, sibling, or teacher, within a relevant environment.

> "The longer I live, the more I realise I’m hardly ever wrong, and that the pains I've taken to verify my thoughts have often just wasted time."

### Imprinting: Learning at Critical Life Stages

Imprinting refers to learning that happens during a specific period of life, and it's rapid, occurring independently of behavioural consequences. For example, **filial imprinting** involves young animals, particularly birds, forming an association with another individual (or even an object), treating it as they would a parent. In 1935, zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that some birds bond with an object that makes sounds.

## Formal Learning and Play as Learning

There are various types of learning through play, and they often overlap. These forms of play encourage children to develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills. As children mature, the specific activities they engage in while playing evolve, and play can either be solitary or involve interaction with others.

Enculturation is the process by which people learn the appropriate values and behaviours required to live within a given culture. This differs from acculturation, where individuals adopt cultural norms and values different from their native ones.

E-learning or online learning has gained significant traction. Mobile learning (m-learning), using devices like smartphones, is a growing form of e-learning, catering to those on the go.

When students engage in e-learning environments, it's often referred to as augmented learning. This form of learning adapts to an individual's environment and can include various media like text, audio, video, and images. Personalised learning like this has been shown to improve lifetime learning outcomes.

**Rote learning** involves memorising content through repetition. While criticised by some educators for being shallow, rote learning remains vital for establishing a foundation in areas like maths, music, and religious studies.

Nonformal learning, distinct from formal systems, happens outside institutional environments, like clubs or youth organisations. On the other hand, informal learning occurs spontaneously, through everyday experiences like eating with family, engaging in play, or observing surroundings.

> "Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth."

Sometimes educational systems combine formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. For instance, the UN and EU acknowledge these different approaches, and some schools grant points for informal learning that happens outside the classroom, like volunteering at international youth workshops or community programmes.

### Internal Factors Influencing Learning

Play is central to children’s development, helping them acquire social skills like sharing and emotional regulation. Additionally, play aids in cognitive development, fostering creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.

**Transfer of learning** involves applying previously acquired knowledge to new and unfamiliar situations. Research shows that transfer is most likely to occur when conditions support it, such as guided practice or reflection.

**Incidental teaching** occurs when learning is an unexpected byproduct of another activity. This can happen through spontaneous experiences, observations, or unplanned events in daily life.
