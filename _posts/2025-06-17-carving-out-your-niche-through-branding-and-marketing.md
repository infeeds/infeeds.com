You want your customers to immediately understand who you are and what kind of appeal you have by simply engaging with your content.

There is so much marketing content around that you need to figure out exactly what makes yours interesting to look at -- even when it sits side by side with the marketing material of your competitor. To be as successful as possible, you need to leave a positive impression on your audiences, becoming the bar by which they internally measure other such content, whether they're aware of that process or not.

The Impact of Good Design
-------------------------
It sounds so obvious that it almost doesn't bear repeating, but it's easy to forget how much of a role striking aesthetics can play in audiences remembering your brand. This is something that's likely to be intertwined with your branding across the board, and you don't want to create a rift where people don't recognize your content because of an unexpected aesthetic flourish. At the same time, there's plenty of room [to experiment](https://clay.global/blog/brand-identity-guide/brand-aesthetic) with graphic design, so this could ultimately be something that evolves your branding into something more flexible.

Good design doesn't only have to relate to imagery, though -- it's also relevant when it comes to how you design your website, your app, and similar platforms. You want these spaces to be enjoyable to use, easy to understand, and aesthetically pleasing -- [a balance](https://www.learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html) that's more difficult to get right than you might initially imagine.

Intertwining Values and Actions
-------------------------------
It's important that your audiences feel as though they understand your business. You don't want them to be confused about what it is that you stand for or even who you're trying to appeal to. One of the primary ways that you can retain a sense of consistency is by synthesizing your brand values with your actions as a business. Naturally, many businesses might say that they care about their audiences and that they're a safe destination for them, but without the proper security, for example, you risk a major contradiction. Taking efforts to avoid this outcome might [involve researching managed detection and response providers](https://redcanary.com/products/managed-detection-and-response/) to give your business a firmer sense of security.

Communication Style
-------------------
How you talk to your audiences will play a large role in how they see you, too. This will, naturally, depend on the personality that you're trying to create for your brand. If you'd like to be seen as more professional and formal in terms of presentation, perhaps going for an air of luxury, then it makes sense that your communication style would be similarly polite and well mannered, yet confident. However, if you fall into the camp of wanting to be more informal and playful with your tone, that arguably gives you more room to play around with how you approach social media marketing. That being said, it's important to have clearly defined boundaries so that you don't risk coming across as rude or abrasive -- you need customers to understand what you're going for.
