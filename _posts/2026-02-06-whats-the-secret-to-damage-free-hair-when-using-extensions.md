If you're planning to get [3a curly hair extensions](https://heatfreehair.com/products/soft-spiral-clip-ins), there are some things you need to do before and while wearing extensions to prevent damage and breakage. You'll miss out on the purpose of wearing extensions if your natural hair suffers in the process. The goal is to keep both in top condition throughout.

## **Ensure Your Natural Hair's Condition**

Correct hair care before getting extensions is key to protecting against damage. 

* Know the signs of a product buildup, such as waxy or sticky hair, lifeless curls, or an itchy scalp.   
* Remove any buildup from hair products you currently or previously use, such as hairspray and styling gels. Even shampoos and conditioners leave buildup on the scalp.   
* Use conditioner to strengthen and moisturize hair.   
* Deep condition if you have fine hair. Use protein-rich masks or keratin treatments to protect every strand and make it stronger.   
* Follow the right treatment routine—use a protein mask or oil treatment weekly, use a moisture mask every two weeks, and do a keratin treatment every month. 

## **Choose Quality Extensions**

Quality should be a priority when choosing hair extensions. 

* The best products help avoid breakage and create that natural look everyone wants.   
* Quality means aligned cuticles to prevent or minimize tangling, something no one wants to deal with, whether with natural hair or extensions.   
* Check for consistency from top to bottom, which is a sign of premium quality. 

## **Consider Professional Installation**

If you're new to wearing extensions, seek professional help.

* An experienced stylist can apply extensions correctly, helping prevent breakage.   
* Incorrect installation, too tight, for example, can cause a headache. If not loosened, hair loss may occur. 

## **Take Care of Extensions**

Care for extensions like you would your natural hair. 

* Follow proper techniques to brush and detangle to prevent matting and shedding.   
* Use the right tools, such as a loop or boar bristle brush, and brush from ends to top.   
* Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle wet hair.   
* Make sure to brush in the morning and before bed daily to keep extensions in great condition. 

## **Protect Extensions the Right Way**

* Before you sleep, brush thoroughly to remove tangles.   
* Tie loosely to prevent misalignment of your natural hair and extension. Use only silk or satin hair accessories.   
* Ensure your hair is thoroughly dried before you sleep or tie it up.  
* When using heat devices, keep settings low and frequency of use to a minimum.   
* Wash and condition extensions with lukewarm water and recommended products.

There are many reasons to use hair extensions. Whatever your reason may be, it’s important to follow a proper care routine, so you can prevent damage and breakage on both natural and fake hair. For quality hair extensions, get yours from Heat Free Hair.
