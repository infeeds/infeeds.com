NDIS or National Disability Insurance Scheme is a social initiative in Australia that aims to support individuals with disabilities as well as their dependents, and careers.

If you are an individual who is exposed to NDIS or who needs to know how this will affect you, here’s a breakdown of this initiative and how you can maximise its benefits.

## **What is NDIS?**

NDIS is a government–funded program for individuals under the age of 65 who have permanent and significant disability. It is a unique model that aims to address the specific needs of its beneficiaries. Some factors considered when availing of the benefits are needs, goals, and lifestyle.

## **Who Is Eligible for the NDIS?**

Any Australian citizen, permanent citizen, or Protected Special Category Visa holder under the age of 65 and who has a disability that is permanent and what significantly impacts their daily life can avail of the NDIS.

## **How Does NDIS Work?**

Since each NDIS package is tailored to each participant, you need to go through a process to properly evaluate your needs and address your concerns. 

Generally, you need to fill out an application to join the scheme. During this stage, you need to prove your eligibility to the program. When you get accepted, you will be attending a planning meeting to discuss your needs, goals, and the support that you require.
