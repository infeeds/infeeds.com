INTRO

D . Em . Bm . G

VERSE

        D                Em           Bm
 You're more than just a notch in my belt
    G
 A story to tell
D         Em            Bm
 The only thing on my mind
          G                  D    Em   Bm  G x2
 And it's keeping me up at night
   D                  Em          Bm
 I know you're making magic somewhere
     G
 But not by yourself
D              Em          Bm
 That might be the reason why
      G                  D    Em   Bm  G x2
 It's keeping me up at night

D       Em              Bm               G
 I can smell you on the pillow where you used to lay
D         Em                 Bm
 And it's keeping me up at night
          G          F#7
 And it's keeping me up

CHORUS

F#7                      G
 Another night, another strangers door
 F#7             G                D   Em   Bm  G x2
 Hoping when it opens I'll see you
 D   Em   Bm  G x2
 You

VERSE

        D                Em           Bm
 You're more than just a notch in my belt
    G
 A story to tell
D         Em            Bm  G
 The only thing on my mind
      D           Em         Bm
 It's obvious I'm not doing well
    G              D                  Em           Bm  G
 Do you see these eyes, when have you known me to cry?
D         Em             Bm            G           D 
 I'm just sitting here remembering how your lips taste
          Em                Bm
 And it's keeping me up at night
          G          F#7
 And it's keeping me up

CHORUS

F#7                      G
 Another night, another strangers door
 F#7             G                D   Em   Bm  G x2
 Hoping when it opens I'll see you
 D   Em   Bm  G x2
 You

Bridge

Bm . G . D . Em

Bm        G
 Wishing I could go back
D         Em
 Wishing I could go back
Bm        G
 Wishing I could go back
D         Em
 Wishing I could go back

F#7 
 To that night
          G
 To that strangers door
F#7               G               D  Em  Bm  G x2
 Knowing when it opened I'd see you
 D  Em  Bm  G
 You
 D  Em  Bm
               D
 That I'd see you

[Outro]

D  Em  Bm  G x4
