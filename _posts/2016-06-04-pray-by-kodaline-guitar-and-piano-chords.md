Tuning : Standard [eBGDAE]

VERSE
```
`C#m                         A`

```
How many nights do you lie dreaming
```

```
C#m                                    A
 I'm counting the days since you went away
```

```
C#m                                A
 When I lost my heart, life lost all meaning
```

```
C#m                            A
 What I would give to see you again
```

```
CHORUS

A              C#m  G#
 I'll pray for you
```

```
A                C#m  G#
 Do you pray for me?
```

```
A              C#m  B 
 I'll pray for you
```

```
VERSE

C#m                                   A
 And you slipped away from me without talking
```

```
C#m                                     A
 The look in your eye was stronger than this
```

```
A                                  E       G#
 And I drink alone to stop me from weeping
```

```
A                                   E
 What's left of my heart is forever yours
```

```
G#
```

```
Forever yours
```

`CHORUS`

`A              C#m  G#`

```
I'll pray for you
```

`A                C#m  G#`

```
Do you pray for me?
```

`A              C#m  B  A`

```
I'll pray for you

C#m . A . C#m . A
B . A . B
```

```
A
I know I know I know I know
```

```
C#m . A . C#m . A
```

`End.`

`pray for me.`
