Call of Duty players have something to celebrate this weekend, though maybe not as much as they'd hoped. Treyarch kicked off a double XP event for Black Ops 7 on Thursday that runs through Monday, but there's a noticeable difference from what the community has grown accustomed to.

This time around, you're only getting double account level XP. That's it. No weapon XP, no battle pass progression boost, and definitely no Quad Feed event where everything gets multiplied at once. For a game that's been pretty generous with its XP events in the past, this feels like a scaled-back affair.

The timing makes sense though. Treyarch is running a free trial weekend simultaneously, letting new players jump into both Multiplayer and Zombies modes without dropping a dime on the game. It's a smart way to get fresh blood into the lobbies while giving existing players an incentive to log in and grind. Veterans can farm kills off curious newcomers while everyone levels up faster than usual.

## When You Can Actually Play

The event went live Thursday at 1 p.m. ET and runs until Monday. If you're in a different time zone, you'll need to do the mental math yourself or check when your [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) platform shows the event timer.

One thing worth noting is that your existing double XP tokens are completely locked during this period. You can't stack them on top of the event boost, and any time you had remaining on active tokens gets frozen until Monday. It's Treyarch's way of preventing players from getting quadruple XP or something equally ridiculous.

The double XP applies across all modes, so whether you're grinding Multiplayer matches, surviving Zombie hordes, or diving into Endgame content, you'll see the benefits. Warzone players are also getting double player XP and double weapon XP during the same timeframe, which is actually a better deal than what Black Ops 7 players are getting.

## What You're Missing Out On

Let's be real about what's absent here. Battle pass progression is still moving at normal speed, which is going to frustrate players who were hoping to knock out a few more tiers before the season ends. Weapon leveling in Black Ops 7 itself also remains unchanged, meaning you'll still be grinding out those attachment unlocks the old-fashioned way.

The Quad Feed events have spoiled the community a bit. When everything gets doubled at once, you can make serious progress across your entire account in a single weekend gaming session. This event feels more like a participation trophy by comparison.

For new players taking advantage of the free trial, the double account XP is genuinely helpful. You'll unlock more loadout options and perks faster than you would during a normal week, which means you won't be completely outgunned by players who've been grinding since launch. But if you've already maxed out your account level, this event offers virtually nothing.

Warzone's inclusion in the event is probably the most interesting angle here. The battle royale mode getting both player and weapon XP boosts while Black Ops 7 gets a single boost type shows where Activision's priorities might be leaning. [Gaming](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=gaming) communities have picked up on this kind of thing before, and it usually sparks some heated discussions on Reddit and Twitter.

The free weekend trial is clearly the main attraction here, with the double XP functioning more as a supporting feature than the headliner. It's a classic move from the game [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) playbook: give people a taste for free, make the experience slightly better than normal, and hope they convert to paid players before Monday rolls around.

Still, free XP is free XP, even if it's not the bounty players were hoping for. If you've been meaning to prestige or just want to knock out a few levels while the getting's good, this weekend is your window. Just don't expect it to feel like the XP bonanzas Treyarch has thrown in the past.
