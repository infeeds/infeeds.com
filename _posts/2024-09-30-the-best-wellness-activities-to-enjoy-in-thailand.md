Head to a massage parlour or spa in your country and there is a good chance you’ll find calm Buddha statues on display, the scent of jasmine or lemongrass in the air, and Thai massage services available. It should come as no surprise that the country these things are from attracts thousands of wellness tourists every year.

There is hardly a better environment in which to destress and improve your health than the tropical setting of Thailand, with its warm, clear water, beautiful beaches, and an amazing array of local fruits and other delicacies.

The country is keen to attract wellness tourists and offers a variety of activities for health-focused visitors. The following are some of the favourites, and they can be enjoyed at dedicated luxury wellness resorts (known as [منتجع العافية الفاخر](https://amatara.com/ar/) in Arabic) or found in shopping centres and districts around the country.

- Thai massage: This one could not be left out. Thai massages are popular all over the world, so of course visitors to Thailand should find time to enjoy one too. They are a great way to relax your muscles, relieve pain, ease your joints, and even improve circulation.

Those unfamiliar with Thai massage should be warned, however, that it is quite unlike other massage practices. It involves a fair amount of stretching and cracking of joints, and the relaxation comes from how good your body feels after, not during, the massage.

- Other massages: Other types of massage can also be found at [spas and parlours](https://infeeds.com/the-benefits-of-owning-a-japan-massage-chair-everything-you-need-to-know/) all over the country. These include relaxing deep tissue massages, hot stone massages, and more.

These share many of the same benefits as Thai massages and are better suited to individuals with certain conditions, such as high blood pressure or varicose veins.

- Meditation: Thailand has one of the world’s largest Buddhist populations, and meditation is an important part of Theravada Buddhism, the dominant school of the religion in the country.

Mindfulness and meditation classes can be found in many places in Thailand, including wellness resorts but also at temples and monasteries. They are often available in different languages, and the length varies from one-hour classes to retreats lasting several days.

- Tai Chi: Tai Chi itself may not be of Thai origin, but heading to a local park in the morning or evening for a public exercise class is how many Thais bookend their day. Best of all, these are open to anyone and usually free.

Tai Chi is a relaxing, low-intensity option, but there are also more upbeat dance and aerobic classes.

- Try the local fruit: Agriculture is still a large part of the lives of many Thai people, which means that the country’s famous markets are always filled with freshly picked fruits and vegetables.

Thailand’s tropical climate is perfect for growing sweet fruits, and many are widely available here which are practically unheard of in many other countries, such as rambutan, mangosteen, salak, and durian. But Thailand grows some of the most delicious varieties of coconuts, pineapple, and papaya too. Thailand is aiming to become a leading global [wellness tourism destination](https://www.thailand.go.th/issue-focus-detail/001_02_342). To this end, it offers amazing services and experiences at low cost relative to other places, in addition to beautiful natural surroundings.
