If you are relying on your 9-to-5 job to provide you with the money that you need to retire early, you are sadly mistaken. You’re going to have to get out there by yourself and use your savings in a more productive way. This involves you investing your hard-earned cash into some of the most effective ways to grow wealth and to meet your financial goals. This, of course, means that you have to have some kind of financial portfolio, and now may be the time to talk to a professional financial adviser.

There are some tried and tested methods, however, that you need to be aware of, and one of them is investing in real estate. Thankfully, you can find a **[residential property for sale in Sydney](https://www.swpre.com.au/buy/residential-for-sale/)** at this very moment, and it has the potential to grow in value over the coming years, to allow you to retire in financial comfort. We only have past statistics to go by, but anyone who invested in a property 25 to 30 years ago can easily sell the property for over $1 million in today’s market. That is a fantastic return on money that was spent almost 3 decades ago.

This is just one way to improve your financial portfolio here in Australia, and the following are some other top tips.

* **Be sure to diversify \-** It is an excellent idea to put your money into residential property, but don’t always put all of your ‘eggs in one basket.’ This is a popular saying in the financial sector, and it makes perfect sense. As well as [investing money in real estate](https://infeeds.com/why-bricks-and-mortar-aided-by-trusted-investment-property-agents-is-a-great-investment), look at other things like stocks, bonds and other commodities.  
* **Don’t rest on your laurels \-** Once you have some kind of financial portfolio set up, just don’t walk away from it and expect it to perform by itself. The markets change over time, and they can go both up and down. This is why you need to regularly have a look at your portfolio to ascertain any risk that you might be experiencing, and maybe move your money elsewhere. Always try to keep your finger on the pulse of what is going on in the markets.  
* **Always talk to the professionals \-** These are individuals who know the financial markets like the back of their hand, and they often find out about opportunities before you ever will. They will try to create some kind of [investment strategy that is personalised to you](https://moneysmart.gov.au/) as an individual. They will ask you about your future plans and the timeframe that they have to work with. Be sure that they are properly certified, have a good record behind them and have many years of experience.

It is important to have peace of mind about your financial future now, so that you can start looking forward to your retirement years. Keep yourself proactive and informed at the same time. You can rely on the professionals, but keep yourself educated as well.
