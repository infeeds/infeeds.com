The word optimist is often used to describe someone foolishly upbeat and unable to acknowledge the negativity in life. Many people find this idea of an optimist to be irritating and not connected to the harsh truths that come with reality. One of the biggest reasons that people refuse to see the world in a more optimistic light is due to associations with an occasion where they had their hopes dashed and were punished for looking on the bright side. However, optimists are definitely not fools. If you would like to brighten your outlook on life but don’t know where to start, here are a few tips to help you get started.

**What Are the Benefits of Being Optimistic?**

First of all, it’s useful to know exactly why being more optimistic is worth your while. Despite the reputation that optimists have for seeing the world through rose-tinted lenses and therefore aren’t able to face reality, people who see the good where others can’t tend to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. Being optimistic isn’t the same as ignoring negative or difficult emotions and experiences. It’s about accepting that there are some parts of life that [can’t be controlled](https://psychcentral.com/blog/coping-with-what-you-cant-control) and every setback is also an opportunity. Once you become more willing to see both the good and the bad, you will be able to live a more peaceful life.

**Learning to Let It Go**

Letting go of whatever old troubles are taking up space in your mind can be an uncomfortable thought, especially if you closely identify with your stoic or pessimistic outlook. One important difference between optimists and other kinds of people is that optimists [don’t hold onto pain unnecessarily](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-let-go). Unhappy events happen in life, but they can be overcome with the right attitude and perseverance.

**Making Time to Unwind**

It isn’t easy to suddenly transform into an optimist, especially if you have been inclined to look for the potential risks or flaws in situations previously. A great way to break down this unhelpful thinking habit is to find little ways of getting your mind and body accustomed to restfulness and contentment. You could put aside time for a bath, enjoy the ritual of a cup of tea, or look for the [best CBD in the UK](https://www.mirror.co.uk/features/best-cbd-gummies-try-uk-26426164) and incorporate it into a self-care routine. It’s easier to be optimistic when you give yourself time to reconnect with yourself and your true emotions.

**Building Resilience for Tougher Times**  
Optimism isn’t simply a foolish outlook that only serves to distract a person from the bad times in life. It can be a hugely effective method of coping with difficulty. It isn’t easy to find the bright side in every situation, but an optimist knows that it’s worth trying. This is because seeing hardships as opportunities can help you to grow as a person. [Resilience](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/resilience/) and gratitude are vital for keeping your mind clear and making the most out of your life.
