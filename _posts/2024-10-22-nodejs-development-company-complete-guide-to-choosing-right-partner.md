Nowadays, in the world of high tempo of digital evolution, business requires flexible, highly performable and efficient applications which can handle increasing loads in terms of users. Today Node.js is one of the most popular platforms for creation of the server-side applications, it provides non-blocking, event-driven I/O which means high speed of application operation. Companies from across the globe are now seeking Node.js development companies to realise applications that are engaging, efficient and real time.

This blog will reveal an insight of what a Node.js development company delivers, why people prefer Node.js and how to choose the right partner for development.

### What is Node.js?

Node.js therefore is an open source, cross platform runtime environment based platform built on JavaScript. It runs on the V8 engine of JavaScript developed for Google Chrome, enabling the Node to execute JavaScript scripts outside a browser. Since it supports multiple clients, the platform is effective in providing synchronous responses and it is suitable for applications such as e-commerce platforms, social networking sites, and collaboration applications.

### Why Choose Node.js for Your Project?

1\. Speed and Performance

Node.js employs the V8 engine that translates JavaScript into machine code for fast execution. This event-driven, non-blocking I/O model adds up its speed to being ideal for developing real-time applications that need instant returns such as chat applications and gaming sites.

2\. Scalability

The biggest strength of Node.js is its scalability. Meaning a [Node.js development company](https://www.aegissofttech.com/nodejs-development-services.html) can add more resources to your application either vertically or horizontally. It is microservices friendly in that each microservice can be grown independently of the other components of the system.

3\. Unified Development

Node.js enables a programmer to write both sides of the application in JavaScript which makes development much easier. This not only accelerates the advancement, but also minimises the cycle for the development team who has prior knowledge regarding the JavaScript language.

4\. Real-Time Capabilities

Node.js is perfect for working with applications that require constant updates such as video and audio streaming, collaborative environments, or instant messaging.
