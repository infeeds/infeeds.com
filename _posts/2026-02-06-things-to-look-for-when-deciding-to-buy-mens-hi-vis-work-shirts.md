It is far more common to see a person wearing a hi vis, or high visibility shirt, than would have been experienced a decade or so ago. It is a specially designed garment that ensures that the wearer is highly noticeable where safety is a concern, made in bright colours such as fluorescent yellow, orange, or lime. Reflective tape that enhances visibility in low-light conditions is an additional feature often added.

Such shirts are worn by people working in construction, road and rail work, warehouses, factories, airports, crowd control, and emergency services, and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Here are some tips for businesses looking to buy [**mens hi vis work shirts**](https://www.totallyworkwear.com.au/mens-hi-vis-shirts) for employees or individuals who work in safety-conscious industries.

* It is imperative that the hi-vis shirt meets recognised safety standards. It’s wise to look for garments that comply with relevant national or international standards, checking them out with the authorities if unsure, as they ensure the colours and reflective materials provide adequate visibility in real working conditions.  
* The visibility and reflective features of a hi-vis shirt must be of a high standard, with it depending on both the fluorescent fabric and the placement of reflective tape. Quality hi-vis shirts use bright dyes and reflective strips that are positioned to be visible from multiple angles, which is especially important for night work or working in environments with reduced light.  
* A hi-vis shirt must be comfortable to wear and fit properly, allowing for easy movement for long periods. Garments made of breathable fabrics that soak up moisture help reduce fatigue and overheating, particularly in physically demanding jobs or warm climates.  
* It is worth checking out reviews on reputable online platforms to ensure that a hi-vis shirt is made from quality fabrics, even if it means spending a little bit more. Workwear is exposed to regular wear, washing, and harsh conditions, which requires it to be durable to remain in good condition by maintaining its shape, colour, and reflective properties over time.  
* The choice of shirt depends on the working environment where it will be worn. Some hi-vis shirts have long sleeves for sun protection, UV-rated fabric, or lightweight designs for hot conditions, improving comfort and safety for the person wearing them.

It is important that when buying a men’s hi-vis work shirt, it complies with regulatory standards, is comfortable and fits properly, with additional features suited to the environment where it will be worn.
