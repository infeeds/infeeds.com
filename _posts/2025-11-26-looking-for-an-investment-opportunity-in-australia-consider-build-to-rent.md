If you are looking to add to your investment portfolio, or you are just beginning to take an interest in your financial future, then you have come to the right place. You will get all of the usual advice about investing in the stock exchange, bonds, and maybe even crypto. You need something more secure, however, and something with much less risk. This is one of the reasons why many investors are looking into property that they can rent.

It is often referred to as **[build to rent](https://www.btrgroup.au/)**, and these are specific properties that are built for rental benefits, and they are not for sale. The properties themselves are incredibly popular, and there are a number of different properties to suit families and single persons. There is absolutely no doubt that the demand for rental housing is on an upward trend here in Australia, so the following are some of the many benefits that you can enjoy by investing in such a thing.

- **Cash flow that is predictable \-** The purpose of building to rent is to provide you with a property that you can rent for the long term. This attracts people who want to rent your property over a long period of time. You can get them to sign a contract that indicates this, and this provides you with a steady and predictable income. You don’t have to worry about your tenants leaving after only a short period of time, leaving your property empty.  
- **It is a popular choice \-** As was touched on briefly before, the rental market here in Australia is very healthy, and potential tenants want to live in a home that is purpose-built for them. This high demand means that [your property will always be occupied](https://infeeds.com/why-bricks-and-mortar-aided-by-trusted-investment-property-agents-is-a-great-investment), that you can charge higher rental rates, and this helps to reduce your overall costs.  
- **There are lower maintenance costs \-** These properties will be brand-new, so there is very little chance of you having to pay any maintenance costs for a great number of years. People try to avoid the older properties that are out there, not due to the fact that they have to do the maintenance because this is your job, but because it is just so inconvenient having tradesmen in the property all the time.  
- **Massive growth potential \-** Once you get a long-term tenant signing an agreement to stay in your property over a number of years, this helps to reduce your stress and anxiety levels. You might even want to [consider purchasing another property](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/assets-and-property/build-to-rent-development-tax-incentives), with the aim of renting it out as well. Before you know it, you have a significant property portfolio that is generating cash for you, all the time.

With regards to investment potential, you don’t just have to stop with one property. If you can get a long-term tenant into one of your buildings, it would make perfect sense that you would want to invest further. Look into it today for a stronger financial future tomorrow.
