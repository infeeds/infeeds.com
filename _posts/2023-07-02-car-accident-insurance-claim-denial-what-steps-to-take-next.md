You’ve been in a serious car accident, and, despite your best efforts, your insurance claim has been denied. What can you do now?

Feeling powerless and at a loss for options? You don’t have to be! There are plenty of steps you can take to fight a car accident insurance claim denial and make sure you’re not left to foot the bill.

From submitting a formal appeal to hiring a lawyer, take a look at what you should do next.

## **Understand the Denial Letter**

When receiving a car accident insurance claim denial, it is essential first to understand the denial letter. It should explain the reasons for the denial. It should also explain the process for appealing if that option is available.

It’s essential to ensure that the insurance company denies the claim, not just delays payment. If appealing the decision is an option, examining the denial letter can help identify the reasons for the denial.

Seeking legal assistance may benefit the insured if the letter does not indicate why the claim was denied. This will help decide if an appeal should be pursued. It can help guide the insured on the appropriate steps to take to ensure the claim is handled properly.

Additionally, consulting knowledgeable insurance professionals can help understand the insurance company’s decision and assisting in the claims process.

## **Identifying Potential Reasons for Claim Denial**

When a car insurance claim is denied, it can be a disheartening and even overwhelming experience. It is important to take the necessary steps to identify why the claim was denied and to prepare an appeal. Here are some reasons for claim denial:

### **Uninsured Motorists Involved in Accidents**

Uninsured motorists involved in accidents may have insurance coverage on their vehicle but could be denied. This is because they lack the necessary coverage for the damage caused. In addition, the at-fault party may not carry liability insurance, or anyone else may be responsible for the accident.

### **Lack of Proper Documentation**

One of the key factors is the lack of proper documentation. Insurance companies require that claimants have strong evidence for their claims. Without adequate proof that the policy covered the accident, the insurance company has no choice but to deny the claim.

### **Excessive Damage After a Car Accident**

The insurer may review the vehicle’s condition before the accident and then compare it to the condition of the vehicle following the accident. If the damage sustained exceeds the damage an insurer would normally expect, the claim can be denied.

### **Failure to Report a Claim Within the Time Period**

Generally, policies specify a set period. This is usually within 24 hours of when a claim should be reported. If the policyholder fails to report their claim during this specified period, they jeopardize their claim.

## **Gathering Documentation in Support of the Claim**

If an insurance company denies a car accident insurance claim due to insufficient evidence, an essential step is to gather definitive documentation supporting the claim. This should include the following:

- contact information for any witnesses
- police or medical reports
- photographs or video of the accident
- any statements from the claimant and other parties involved

It is also important to document any conversations with the insurance company and any communication with the other party’s insurance company, especially if they have denied liability. This helps to provide a record in case it needs to be referenced later.

Finally, keeping all communication with the insurance company orderly and well-organized is essential. This, though it can be time-consuming, may be beneficial in the long run.

## **Consulting an Attorney**

If an insurance company has denied an appeal claim, consulting an attorney is one of the most important steps that should be taken next. An experienced personal injury attorney like the ones [here](https://alphaaccidentlawyers.com/) can assess the facts of the case and provide legal advice about the best way to proceed.

An attorney can help an individual affected by a car accident secure the necessary financial resources to cover medical bills and repair costs. An attorney can also help a person affected by a car accident negotiate with the insurance company to resolve the denied claim favorably.

Attorneys may be able to help people affected by car accidents obtain financial compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the accident. Consulting an attorney is an important step after a car accident insurance claim has been denied.

## **Filing an Appeal with the Insurance Company**

Filing an [appeal with the insurance company](https://www.healthcare.gov/appeal-insurance-company-decision/) is one of the steps to take if your car accident insurance claim is denied. You should write a letter to the insurance company outlining why you think the claim should be reconsidered and what evidence you have to support your position.

Make sure to include your name, account number, policy number, and details of the incident. Be respectful, honest, and straightforward. Be sure to attach any documents that may help your case, such as witness statements, proof of car repairs, or medical bills.

Include a contact number and address in your letter so the insurance company can reach out if they have any questions. Contact the insurance company if you do not hear back within a few weeks to make sure they have received your letter and to inquire about the status of your appeal.

## **Preparing for a Lawsuit if Necessary**

If your car accident insurance claim has been denied, the next step you will need to take is to look into preparing for a lawsuit, if necessary.

If a lawsuit is necessary, your attorney will help you through all the necessary steps, such as filing legal paperwork, representing you in court, and collecting any awards or settlements.

## **Understanding What Other Legal Options Are Available After a Denial**

A legal appeal may be appropriate if the denial was unjustified or inadequate. Suing the insurance company in small claims court is another option for those who believe they have been wrongfully denied.

Depending on the facts, a complaint may be possible with the insurance regulator in the state in which the policy was purchased.

## **Learn What to Do After a Claim Denial**

The best approach to take after a car accident insurance claim denial is to reach out to a knowledgeable attorney. An attorney experienced in insurance claims can help you figure out what, if any, options you have and help you with the appeals process.
