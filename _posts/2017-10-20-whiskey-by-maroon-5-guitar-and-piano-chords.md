 Would've sold my soul

For a little more time

```
A#                                               Gm
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
```

```
D#
(Feelin' light and dizzy, make me tipsy)
```

`All that tequila is a killer, little vodka break or something proper`

```
A#
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
```

(Every time you kiss it, like some whiskey)
```

```
D#
Construct love, it's a fine line
```

`Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine`

```
A#                    Gm
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
```

`She done got off my heart`

```
