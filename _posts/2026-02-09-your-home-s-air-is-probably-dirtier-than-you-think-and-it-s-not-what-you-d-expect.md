If you think the air inside your home is cleaner than what's outside, I have bad news. Indoor air can be five times more polluted than outdoor air, according to James Langer, a materials science engineer and CEO of Colorfil. That's not just uncomfortable. It can lead to headaches, chronic allergies, asthma, and in some cases, even cancer.

Winter makes everything worse. When it's freezing outside, we seal up our homes like bunkers. Windows stay shut, heating systems work overtime, and all those pollutants we'd normally ventilate out just sit there, circulating through the same stale air. Michael Rubino, founder of HomeCleanse and chairman of the Change the Air Foundation, points out that indoor air isn't nearly as healthy as most people assume.

You can buy air purifiers and dehumidifiers, sure. But if you don't know where the pollution is coming from, you're just treating symptoms. I talked to air quality experts about the things in your home that are quietly trashing your air quality, and some of these are going to surprise you.

## That Dinner You're Cooking Is Polluting Your Air

Gas stoves get all the attention when it comes to indoor air pollution, and for good reason. But here's the kicker: it doesn't matter if you have gas or electric. Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America and a certified indoor environmentalist, says cooking is the number one contributor to indoor air pollution, period.

High-heat cooking, especially over open flames or burners, releases p.m. 2.5. That's particulate matter small enough to get deep into your lungs. We worry about smells, but the real danger is invisible. Even if you're baking something in the oven or reheating leftovers in the microwave, you're still introducing pollutants into your [Technology](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=technology) equipped home.

Switching to induction cooking helps a lot, according to Dolphin Hammes. So does installing a real exhaust fan, and she emphasizes "real" because 99% of exhaust fans just recirculate dirty air back into your kitchen instead of venting it outside. If you can't upgrade your ventilation system, at least crack a window when you cook.

## Your HVAC System Might Be Making Things Worse

The system that's supposed to keep your air clean could be doing the opposite. HVAC systems that aren't properly maintained become breeding grounds for mold and dust. Then they just pump that contaminated air throughout your entire house.

Rubino explains that modern buildings are designed for energy efficiency, which sounds great until you realize that means almost no airflow between indoor and outdoor environments. Pollutants get trapped inside with nowhere to go unless you actively remove them.

Get your HVAC system serviced twice a year. Change your air filters on schedule and upgrade to the highest-rated MERV filters your unit can handle. Higher MERV ratings mean the filter can catch smaller particles. It's basic maintenance, but most people don't do it until something breaks.

## Those Cleaning Products Are Doing More Harm Than Good

Keeping a clean house should help with air quality, right? Not if you're using conventional cleaning products. The ones that make big claims about killing germs or eliminating odors are usually loaded with volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.

VOCs cause nausea and can have serious health effects if you're exposed to high levels over time. Langer recommends looking for low-fragrance or fragrance-free cleaning products. Better yet, make your own with simple ingredients you probably already have.

A damp cloth works fine for wiping up dust on surfaces. You don't need a chemical arsenal to keep your [home](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=lifestyle) clean. The marketing around cleaning products has convinced us that we need specialized formulas for every surface, but most of that is just adding unnecessary pollutants to our air.

## Your Ice Machine And Water Dispenser Are Growing Mold

Everyone knows bathrooms and laundry rooms can get moldy. What most people don't think about is the kitchen, specifically appliances that hold water. Your refrigerator's ice machine and water spout can hide mold, according to Rubino. Same goes for your shower and washing machine.

Mold spores trigger respiratory problems even if you don't have allergies. They also create musty odors that make you want to cover them up with air fresheners, which just compounds the problem.

Clean these appliances regularly. Let them dry out between uses. It's annoying maintenance that no one wants to do, but it beats breathing in mold spores every time you grab ice for your drink.

## Candles And Incense Are Trashing Your Air Quality

This one hurts because people love their candles. But anything that emits smoke is going to decrease your air quality, even if it seems like a small amount. Dolphin Hammes says candles and incense are frequently a source of pollution, not a solution to bad smells.

When you light a candle, you're introducing high amounts of p.m. 2.5 into your home. The same goes for incense. Air fresheners, essential oils, and other heavily fragranced products are often used to mask odors, but Langer points out that they just make indoor air pollution worse.

If you have pets, this is even more concerning. There's almost no data on how safe these products are around animals. Dogs, cats, birds, and small animals might be much more susceptible to negative side effects because of their unique biology. Instead of fragranced products, consider using an air purifier or look for air fresheners made with baking soda or activated charcoal.

## Should You Get An Air Quality Monitor?

If you're worried about what you're breathing, a monitor gives you real-time data so you can figure out what's causing problems. The SwitchBot Meter Pro costs about $60 and tracks carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity. The Airthings View Plus runs around $300 and monitors VOCs, radon, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity.

Both devices send alerts when levels get dangerous. They're not magic solutions, but they help you understand what's happening in your [home](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=tech) so you can actually fix the problem instead of guessing.

The irony is that we seal ourselves inside during winter to stay warm and comfortable, and in doing so, we're breathing air that's potentially five times more polluted than what's outside our front door.
