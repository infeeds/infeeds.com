As it's shown below.
```

```
VERSE :

             Am                    G       
I'll sing it one last time for you
```

```
Am               G
Then we really have to go
```

```
Am                     G
You've been the only thing that's right
```

```
Am     G
In all I've done
```

```
Am                 G
And I can barely look at you
```

```
Am              G
But every single time I do
```

```
Am             G
I know we'll make it anywhere
```

```
Am     G
Away from here
```

```
CHORUS :

C
 Light up, light up
```

```
G
 As if you have a choice
```

```
Am
 Even if you cannot hear my voice
```

```
F
 I'll be right beside you dear
```

```
C
 Louder louder
```

```
G
 And we'll run for our lives
                       Am
```

```
I can hardly speak I understand
                                    F
 Why you can't raise your voice to say

Again Repeat the Intro Part :
```

```
VERSE :

           Am                      G
To think I might not see those eyes
```

```
Am                G
Makes it so hard not to cry
```

```
Am                 G
And as we say our long goodbye
```

```
Am   G
I nearly do
```

`CHORUS :`

`C`

```
Light up, light up
```

```
G
```

```
As if you have a choice
```

```
Am
```

```
Even if you cannot hear my voice
```

```
F
```

```
I'll be right beside you dear
```

`C`

```
Louder louder
```

```
G
```

```
And we'll run for our lives
```

```
Am
```

```
I can hardly speak I understand
```

```
F
```

```
Why you can't raise your voice to say
```

```
C    
 Slower slower
```

```
G
 We don't have time for that
```

```
Am
 All I want's to find an easy way
```

```
F
 To get out of our little heads
```

```
C 
 Have heart, my dear
                 G
 We're bound to be afraid
                        Am
 Even if it's just for a few days
                          F
 Making up for all this mess
```

`CHORUS :`

`C`

```
Light up, light up
```

```
G
```

```
As if you have a choice
```

```
Am
```

```
Even if you cannot hear my voice
```

```
F
```

```
I'll be right beside you dear
```

```
END.
