INTRO

C

VERSE

C                           F
You just, you made it look easy
                      Am
It's like you didn't feel it
          F
Not like I do
  C                          F
I followed, I followed the pieces
              Am
I tried to receive it
              F
To when it was good

CHORUS

           C 
Oh look, I don't wanna feel like somebody
              F
While nothing else ever feels like your body
          Am
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
      F
For a moment there, it was permanent
             C
I drive the streets when you told me your secrets
         F
We made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it
       Am
And we held the world, we were turning it
      F
For a moment there, it was permanent

INSTRUMENTAL PART

C . F . Am. F
C . F . Am. F

VERSE

C                              F
I'll bet, I'll bet you're in Seoul
              Am
Dancing in slow-mo
            F
With someone new, oh
  C                                 F
I cared, I, I hope you'll never forget it
                      Am
The night's just too weary
               F
Like all your tattoos

CHORUS

           C 
Oh look, I don't wanna feel like somebody
              F
While nothing else ever feels like your body
          Am
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
      F
For a moment there, it was permanent
             C
I drive the streets when you told me your secrets
         F
We made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it
       Am
And we held the world, we were turning it
      F
For a moment there, it was permanent

[Outro]

     C
Permanent
     F
Permanent
     Am
Permanent
      F
For a moment there
It was permanent

End.

- in this World Everything is Temporary.
