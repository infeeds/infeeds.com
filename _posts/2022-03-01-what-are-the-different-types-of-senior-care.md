After years of being independent, it can sometimes feel strange or difficult to admit when you start to need help again. Although many senior citizens are still able to live independently and are in great health, others might find themselves starting to struggle physically, mentally, or both as they turn another year older. It is important to make sure that you or a beloved senior relative of yours has the right support in place, and below are some of the options of senior care available that you may want to explore.

## **Assisted Living** 

Assisted living facilities are brilliant for seniors who might need some help managing basic daily tasks, such as grooming, bathing, household chores, and meal preparation. They can also get help with medication management and an opportunity to make new friends in these homes. There are often organized activities on-site, such as movie nights, dances, book clubs, and exercise classes, as well as opportunities to go on day trips to places of interest as a group. There are carers on-site 24/7, so even if they need assistance in the early hours of the morning, someone will be there to support them.

## **Memory Care**

Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are, unfortunately, not uncommon issues facing the senior community. These conditions can be upsetting for both the patient and their loved ones, especially as they progress and become more severe. Memory care had been specifically designed for those dealing with these conditions, and there are options for day centers that can offer some respite for family members who might be caring for their loved ones. Alternatively, there are also residential [homes for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia care](https://mcknightplace.com/memory-care/) for those who need around-the-clock care and to be in a safe environment.

## **Nursing Homes**

Nursing homes are different from those listed above, as they are designed for people who need ongoing medical care due to health conditions. An individual who had been living in an assisted living facility might find themselves moving into a nursing home should their health deteriorate and they require more intensive medical attention to keep them comfortable. There is often [palliative care](https://getpalliativecare.org/whatis/) offered in nursing homes as well.

## **Live-in Carers/Home Visits**

Moving into a residential care home isn’t the right fit for everyone, and for those who would prefer not to move, you can always explore the option of having a nurse/carer coming to the house for regular visits or even moving in as a live-in carer. This can be a more comfortable option for those who are anxious about leaving their homes and would like to stay where they are but also are struggling to live independently.

## **Retirement Communities**

Finally, [retirement communities](https://www.irt.org.au/the-good-life/the-benefits-of-living-in-a-retirement-village/) are designed for those who are still able to look after themselves but perhaps are lonely and would like to be around people in their age group. These communities can offer private accommodation such as small houses or apartments will have organized activities on-site for interests, exercises, and socializing. They might also have a hairdresser/beauty salon on-site, a restaurant, and perhaps even a small convenience store for the residents to buy the basics.

If you are wondering what the best option is for yourself as a senior citizen or a member of your family who might need to think about senior care, use the list above as a way to help you figure it out.
