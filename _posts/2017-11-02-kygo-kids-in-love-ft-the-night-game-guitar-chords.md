VERSE

Am           Em      F
 This is our last goodbye
Am              Em   F
 Don't come and find me
Am          Em     F
 So hard to see you cry
   Am             Em    F
 Please, somebody blind me

Pre-Chorus

       G       Am
'Cause I can feel it
          Em                  F
I'm still lagging onto every word
   G          Am
My heart is beating
        Em                     F
And I'm sorry that I left you hurt

CHORUS

C   Em  F
         We were kids in love
C   Em  F
         And then we grew up
C   Em  F                         Am 
         But won't you hold me close tonight
Em  F
      Like we're kids in love?
C   Em  F
         Kids in love
C   Em  F
         Kids in love
C   Em  F         Am   Em  F
         Kids in love

INTRUMENTAL PART

Post-Chorus

                 C   Em  F x3
We were kids in love
                     Am  Em  F
                 C
We were kids in love

VERSE

Am          Em     F
 Engine on, in the drive
Am           Em F
 Running for hours
Am          Em       F
 Slowly, we twist the knife in
Am            Em F
 Folding like towers

Pre-Chorus

    G      Am
And I can feel it
          Em                     F
And we're running out of hope tonight
  G          Am
I hear you breathing
         Em                    F
As we're hanging on to you and I, oh

CHORUS

C   Em  F
         We were kids in love
C   Em  F
         And then we grew up
C   Em  F                         Am 
         But won't you hold me close tonight
Em  F
      Like we're kids in love?
C   Em  F
         Kids in love
C   Em  F
         Kids in love
C   Em  F         Am   Em  F
         Kids in love

[Outro]

Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
                 C   Em  F x3
We were kids in love
                 Am  Em  F
          C   Em  F
One last time, 
          C   Em  F
one last time
        C            Em        F
And wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever
  Am                    Em      F
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you

                 C   Em  F
We were kids in love
                 C   Em  F
We were kids in love (oh)
         C   Em  F
Kids in love (oh)
         Am  Em  F
Kids in love (oh)

End.
