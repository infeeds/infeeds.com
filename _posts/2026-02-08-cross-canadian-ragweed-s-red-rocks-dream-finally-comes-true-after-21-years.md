Some grudges are worth holding onto. For Cody Canada, frontman of Cross Canadian Ragweed, that grudge has been festering for 21 years. Back in 2005, when his band opened for Dierks Bentley at Red Rocks, they got bumped to a shortened first set because some guy with a radio hit needed a slot. Canada won't name names, but you can feel the sting still lingering when he talks about it.

"I always kind of wanted to come back and do a full set just to redeem that moment," Canada told Rolling Stone. Well, redemption is coming on July 24, 2026, when Cross Canadian Ragweed headlines the legendary Colorado venue for the first time.

This isn't just another tour date. When the band reunited in 2025 after a 15-year hiatus, Red Rocks was the first thing Canada mentioned to his agent. Not a maybe, not a someday. It was the benchmark, the goal that would prove their comeback meant something real.

## A Second Chance They Won't Waste

The reunion tour last year was a gamble that paid off in sold-out stadium shows. Canada knows lightning rarely strikes twice in the [entertainment](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=entertainment) world. "I told everybody, let's take advantage of our second chance, because we probably don't get a third one," he said.

That urgency shows in how the band has approached 2026. They're not treating this like a nostalgia trip. They headlined the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, kicked off Mile 0 Fest in Key West with a Duval Street block party, and they're gearing up for multiple Boys From Oklahoma shows with Turnpike Troubadours.

The Athens, Georgia dates at Akins Ford Arena sold out so fast they added a second night. Canada spent months obsessing over the setlist before finally handing the reins to drummer Randy Ragsdale. "He likes making it anyway, because of the tempos in the songs," Canada admitted.

## Family Business at Red Rocks

Here's where the Red Rocks show gets really special. Instead of loading the bill with big-name acts from the Red Dirt and Americana scenes like their other stadium dates, this one's all about family. Canada's sons Dierks and Willy will open with their metalcore band Waves in April, alongside singer Elle Gorman. Grady Cross's son Slaid and nephew Colton Blake will perform with their Red Dirt outfit The Smokin' Oaks.

"I'm probably gonna cry more that night than I did the first night in Stillwater," Canada said. You can't fake that kind of emotion. This isn't some calculated [business](https://infeeds.com/tags/?tag=business) move to create a viral moment. It's a dad getting to share the biggest stage of his career with his kids.

The scale of these shows is still new territory for Ragweed. Unlike Turnpike Troubadours, who've been filling arenas consistently since their 2022 comeback, Ragweed built their reputation in clubs and at festivals before breaking up in 2010. Now they're playing stadiums like it's normal.

Canada says the big venues are actually less nerve-wracking than intimate rooms. "Smaller rooms are more nerve-wracking than stadiums, because there's no forgiveness. People can hear better and there's no chatter if you mess up," he explained. The stadium energy carries you through mistakes, turns them into moments instead of disasters.

## The Road Ahead

After Red Rocks, the Boys From Oklahoma tour hits Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska on August 22 with Cody Jinks, Flatland Cavalry, and American Aquarium. That Stillwater show at Boone Pickens Stadium on April 11 features Wyatt Flores, Shane Smith and the Saints, and the Great Divide.

These aren't just concert announcements. They're proof that regional scenes can build sustainable careers without chasing mainstream country radio or Nashville's approval. Cross Canadian Ragweed spent years grinding it out, broke up when it stopped working, and came back when the time felt right. No big label push, no reality TV storyline, just a band that meant something to people getting another shot to do what they do best.

Twenty-one years is a long time to wait for redemption, but some venues are worth the wait, and some moments only mean something when you've earned them the hard way.
