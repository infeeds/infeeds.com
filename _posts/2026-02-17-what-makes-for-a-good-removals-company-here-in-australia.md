Sooner or later, moving house is something we all have to endure and to be honest, most people dread relocating their personal possessions, and who could blame them? Of course, the obvious solution is to hire an established removalist, a company with the know-how and the resources to carry out the move without incident. Hiring such a company can be easier said than done, and with that in mind, here are a few attributes you would expect a top-rated removals company to possess.

* **Reliable and responsible** – Their word should be their bond, and if one of the top [**removalists in North Lakes**](https://readymovers.com.au/north-lakes/) tells you they will be there at 7 am in the morning, you can be sure they will be on time\! It is obviously critical that the move follows the agreed timeline, and a top-rated removalist would understand this.  
* **Transparent pricing** – An all-inclusive quote should be just that; nothing added, regardless of any extra work that might have been required. This means you can budget the move with some confidence. The bill should be detailed, so you know where every dollar went. All packing materials should be included in the price, regardless of how much is used.  
* **Comprehensive service** – Moving house can be a stressful experience, unless you have an experienced team that knows how to make you feel at ease. They move people for a living, and there’s nothing they haven’t seen, which should make you feel relaxed. They understand why people are nervous, and they have learned how to relax the customer.  
* **Nothing is too much trouble** – Working with strangers can feel uncomfortable; you are afraid to ask if they could fix a small issue you notice, but after a while, you realise that they actually like pleasing the customer. The team is service-minded, and they totally get why you might be concerned about that grand piano or that delicate tapestry that’s been in your family for generations.

* **Competitive pricing** – The best doesn’t have to be the most expensive, although in some instances, it is. A good removalist would not charge more than their competitors, and their second-to-none service is what makes the difference. Such a company would get many referrals from existing customers, which means they rely less on marketing.  
* **Resources \-** The unexpected has a habit of showing up just when you didn’t want it, and a truck breakdown should not affect your move; an established company would have a large fleet and at least several trucks on stand-by in case of a breakdown. Additional staff would always be on hand, should a worker call in sick, so you can be sure that your project will not be postponed or delayed.

The first step is to Google ‘removalists near me’ and browse the list of sites until you find one that looks the part. They should be a member of a [recognised federation or association](https://www.aima.com.au/), which is easily checked.
