### **Stealthy Approaches**

Approaching your fishing spots stealthily is essential to avoid spooking the fish. Employ stealth techniques such as paddling softly and making minimal sudden movements. The quieter you are, the more fish you’ll encounter.

## **Tackle and Bait**

### **Lighter Tackle**

Consider using lighter tackle to make your battles with fish more exhilarating. Lighter gear allows you to feel every tug and dive, adding a new level of excitement to your fishing experience.

Experiment with both live bait and lures to determine what works best in your specific fishing location. Different fish species have varied preferences, so having a range of options can significantly increase your chances of success.

### **Weather Watch**

Stay informed about the weather conditions before heading out onto the water. Sudden changes in weather can be not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Keep a close eye on forecasts and be prepared to adjust your plans accordingly.
