Are you ready to throw a party that every guest talks about for months to follow, and everyone who didn’t attend wishes they had? It can often feel like the most magical nights happen by accident, but that’s not necessarily the case. For a truly standout party, the planning process needs to be immaculate. 

So, what do the most unforgettable parties have in common? By learning from these, you can throw your very own. 

## **The Perfect Backdrop**

It’s all about the location. There are many types of [party venues](https://hartfordsocietyroom.com/private-parties/) available, depending on where you want to throw the party. You could stick to a more traditional venue that includes a dance floor and bar, or you could throw a party on a beach or in your backyard\! Remember that the location matters a lot. You not only want to make sure the place is well decorated and in keeping with the theme, but that there’s also enough space for everyone. Keep in mind the layout, for example, ensuring there is a clear walkway through the space. 

## **A Soundtrack that Everyone Wants to Dance to**

When it comes to a great party, the music is almost everything. When [creating a playlist](https://wvau.org/blogs/the-art-of-playlist-making/) (or hiring a band/DJ), be aware that it’s not just your own tastes you should cater to, but also the preferences of everyone else in attendance\! Consider things like age range, for example. To make sure you please everyone, you could have a system that allows song requests. 

## **Interactive Elements**

These are the things that get people actively involved in the party. It gets people out of their seats and doing something, rather than just sitting around and waiting for something to happen\! These interactive elements may include: 

* A video game area  
* A photo booth  
* Karaoke   
* DIY food stations  
* Trivia games  
* Creative stations

## **Incredible Things to Eat and Drink**

When people attend parties, they want to know that they will be well fed and watered. The food is a major part of any event, so make sure you serve up something delicious, whether that’s finger food or full meals. When it comes to the drinks, try something a little more exciting, such as [themed cocktails](https://www.arcoroc.com/blog/tips-for-making-a-unique-cocktail/), not forgetting to provide options for people who don’t drink alcohol\!

## **A Theme that Ties it Altogether**

Many of the most unforgettable parties have an underlying theme tying them all together. That doesn’t necessarily mean you need to throw a full-blown pirates, Hollywood, or 80s themed party (although you can do that\!), but you should have an idea of what vibe the party gives off. For example, you may want to throw a party that feels like stepping into the 1920s, or a party that uses green and floral decorations to make it feel like a fairytale. 

## **A Moment of Emotion**

People remember what they feel far more than anything else. As such, parties that include a moment of emotion stand out more than any other. Of course, the type of moment you choose depends on the party you are having. It could be something as simple as a heartfelt speech from a loved one to the birthday party host, or it could be sharing a surprise, such as announcing an upcoming wedding or a pregnancy.
