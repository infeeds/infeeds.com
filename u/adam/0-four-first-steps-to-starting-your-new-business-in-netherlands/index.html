Thanks to a variety of benefits, such as tax incentives, allowances and, of course, freedom of movement for EU citizens, the nation has fostered a reputation for being one of the most welcoming and most profitable countries a new company could hope to be set up in.</p>
<br>
<p>However, as we all know, starting a new business in a new country is never as simple as just renting an office space and declaring yourself CEO. Just like every other nation, The Netherlands has its own rules, regulations and quirks as well as benefits, so here are a few things you need to know before you start the process.</p>
<br>
<h3>Can You Actually Stay And Work In The Netherlands?</h3>
<p>It’s a simple question but it’s one we can’t move forward without addressing. EU citizens have the advantage of freedom of movement to live and work where they please within the 27 nation states, but if you’re coming from outside the EU, you will need to apply for a <a href="https://business.gov.nl/coming-to-the-netherlands/permits-and-visa/coming-to-the-netherlands-as-an-entrepreneur/">residence permit</a>. A short stay visa will set you up for 180 days, and a provisional residence permit can be granted if you meet all the conditions for a residence permit, which is required if you want to stay for more than 90 days. And, of course, if you’re working you will need a work permit (or TWV, translating as tewerkstellingsvergunning).</p>
<br>
<h3>Is Your Registration In Order?</h3>
<p>When you’re setting up your company in The Netherlands, you need to make sure you have filed the correct forms depending on what kind of business you’re starting (one-person business, private limited company, public limited company, etc.) and you will need to register said business with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, or KvK (Kamer van Koophandel). While the formation of a company in The Netherlands can be overseen by a single person, if there are shareholders or board members who have more than a 25% stake, they will need to be available to provide a copy of their passport and proof of address and further information. Which brings us to the next point…</p>
<br>
<h3>Can You Make Things Easier?</h3>
<p>While you do not need to be a Dutch citizen to set up your own company in the Netherlands, there are several advantages to having a Dutch director to help your business hit the ground running. Their local know-how will help make sure that all the specific Dutch system requirements are met and can set your mind at ease. You can <a href="https://www.incobusinessgroup.com/dutch-directorship-services">find more information</a> here about how Dutch directorship could help your company, as Inco Business Group has a range of services and years of experience to help navigate the legal and business waters.</p>
<br>
<h3>Which City Should You Be Based In?</h3>
<p>It makes sense that a lot of new businesses looking to set up in The Netherlands head to the capital city of Amsterdam, but it’s well worth doing your research to find the right match for your company. Rotterdam’s huge port makes it a great fit for many trading companies, and tech companies are flocking to cities with excellent technical universities like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/15/its-what-students-look-for-the-dutch-university-thats-only-hiring-women">Eindhoven</a> and Delft. Don’t just head for the capital, do your leg-work and talk to the local experts to find the place your business belongs.</p></div><div class="social-butz"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/four-first-steps-to-starting-your-new-business-in-netherlands" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="icon ic-fb"></span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/four-first-steps-to-starting-your-new-business-in-netherlands&amp;text=Four First Steps To Starting Your New Business In The Netherlands&amp;via=infeeds" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="icon ic-tw"></span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="oflow"></div></div><div class="hidden footer-holder"><div class="footer"><a href="javascript:;" class="if-copyr">© 2021 Infeeds</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/about?ref=footer">about</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/premium?ref=footer">premium</a> <!--<a href="https://infeeds.com/services/careers">careers</a>--> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/terms?ref=footer">terms</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/contact?ref=footer">contact</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/help?ref=footer">help</a></div></div></body></html>
