While members of older generations might not be as tech-savvy as their grandchildren, there are a lot of tech devices that they might find useful to manage their daily lives. Below is are some examples of the kind of tech that senior citizens might find beneficial.</p>

<h3>Video Calling Technology</h3>
<p>Video chats are everywhere, and you can use a smartphone, tablet, laptop/computer to make them. There are even devices that are designed specifically for video calls, such as <a href="https://www.alphr.com/facebook-portal-easy-to-use-elderly/">Portal</a> to help people stay in touch. It’s a great way to check in on your senior relatives, and they can see their grandchildren more often if they don’t live nearby. During the pandemic, video calls have been more useful than ever for people to stay connected when they can’t physically meet up and have been particularly useful for anyone living alone to feel less isolated, particularly senior citizens.</p>

<h3>Smart Security Systems</h3>
<p>Another very useful piece of tech for senior citizens is smart security systems for their homes. Unfortunately, the seniors are often targeted by thieves as they are more vulnerable, and no one should feel unsafe in their homes. Having smart security can make seniors feel safer at home and offer their families peace of mind. Using video cameras so that they can see who is at their door and access these cameras via an app when they aren’t home is a great way to make sure there are no unwanted visitors on their property.</p>

<h3>Fall Detection Technology</h3>
<p>It’s not uncommon for seniors to have slips and falls, particularly if they have a medical condition that impairs their balance or suffering from dementia. These falls can result in serious injury and be traumatic at times, which is why using <a href="https://www.belmontvillage.com/caregiver-family-resources/innovative-fall-detection-technology-in-senior-living-community-reduces-fall-related-injuries-and-er-visits/">fall detection technology</a> can be hugely beneficial. It can help to reduce trips to the emergency room and make seniors feel safer as if they do fall, an alert can be sent out to their carers instantly, which means they will get the help they need sooner rather than later. Through the use of AI and cameras, these alerts are sent out and are brilliant for assisted living facilities or families who are caring for a senior relative.</p>

<h3>Smartwatches</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gadgetreview.com/best-smartwatch-seniors">Smartwatches</a> can help you monitor your health and exercise for the day and allow you to set reminders on your calendar and receive notifications and messages from your contacts. This kind of technology is useful to everyone, but especially for seniors who might need to remember what time to take medication or when they have social engagements or appointments. It can also help them keep track of their daily step count if they want to remain active for the good of their health.</p>

<p>There is a lot of technology out there that is useful to seniors, the above just being a few examples that are worth exploring if you want to look after a senior relative.</p></div><div class="social-butz"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/technology-that-can-benefit-lives-of-senior-citizens" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="icon ic-fb"></span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/technology-that-can-benefit-lives-of-senior-citizens&amp;text=Technology That Can Benefit the Lives of Senior Citizens&amp;via=infeeds" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="icon ic-tw"></span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="oflow"></div></div><div class="footer-holder"><style>.thread-plu{width:90%;max-width:60em;margin:2em auto 5em}.publish-story{position:fixed;right:0;top:0;margin:1em;z-index:9999999}.publish-story button{width:100%;color:#fff;border:0;font-weight:500;line-height:1.5em;font-size:1em;padding:.5em 1em;border-radius:3px;background-color:#c562a9;text-transform:lowercase;transition:.5s;cursor:pointer;box-shadow:0 1px 8px -4px #c562a9}.publish-story button:hover{background-color:#af5b8a}.fb-comments iframe{min-height:200px!important;width:100%!important}.fb-comments span{vertical-align:unset!important;display:block;margin:0 auto;min-height:200px}.fb-comments{margin:0 auto;width:-webkit-fill-available}</style><div class="footer"><a href="javascript:;" class="if-copyr">© 2021 Infeeds</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/about?ref=footer">about</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/premium?ref=footer">premium</a> <!--<a href="https://infeeds.com/services/careers">careers</a>--> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/terms?ref=footer">terms</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/contact?ref=footer">contact</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/help?ref=footer">help</a></div></div><a href="https://apps.mgks.dev/infeeds/?submit" title="Share your story" class="publish-story"><button>Submit Guest Post</button></a></body></html>
