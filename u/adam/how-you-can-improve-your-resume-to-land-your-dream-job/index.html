Because your resume is so important in getting your dream job, it is vital that you get it right the first time around. You do not get a second chance to make a positive first impression, so getting it right is a necessity. To get your resume right, though, what do you need to include, and how should it be laid out?</p>

<h3>Focus on the Content</h3>
<p>The content of your resume is just as important as how it looks and how it reads. If your resume is full of jargon or perhaps full of useless information, then you will struggle to get seen and noticed. The content contained within your resume needs to be of high quality, and it needs to make an impact. If the content is not standing out to those reading it, you will not be able to create a positive lasting impression.</p>

<h3>Think About Quality and Not Only Quantity</h3>
<p>As well as focusing on the content, you also have to ensure that quality oozes from every section of your resume. If your resume is more than 2 pages long, then you have focused your <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/personal-traits-to-include-on-your-resume">attention on quantity instead of quality</a>. Quality must be upheld throughout your resume. To ensure that quality is upheld, you need to read your resume through the eyes of an employer. Seeing how your resume comes across and how it reads is something that you must focus your attention and time on. If you are struggling to read your resume from another personâ€™s angle, then you need to look at employing the services of a professional resume writer.</p>

<h3>Be Truthful and Honest</h3>
<p>When you are improving your resume, it can be tempting to stretch or bend the truth, especially if you are <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/resume-tips-help-land-your-dream-job/">going for your dream job</a>. However, this can be damaging to your application and to any future applications. Therefore, it is always best, to be honest and truthful in your application and resume. If you are not honest and truthful, then you could get caught out, and it could jeopardize any opportunity you get or have been given.</p>

<h3>Share Your Experiences</h3>
<p>Potential employers love to hear about the experiences you have had. The experiences you have had shape and mold you into the person you are, so do not be afraid to share them (when appropriate, of course). For example, if you have volunteered with the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation.html/">American Red Cross</a> or perhaps another voluntary organization, then make sure you mention this. Having a diverse range of experiences is quite often what a lot of employers look for.</p>

<h3>Be Clear and Concise</h3>
<p>Your resume has to be clear and concise at all times. If potential employers struggle to read your resume, or if they struggle to make sense of what you are trying to say, then it will be favorable to your outcome. Take your time to read over your resume As many times as you need to and ensure that it is concise, clear and to the point at all times.</p></div><div class="social-butz"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="icon ic-fb"></span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://infeeds.com/u/adam/&amp;text=How You Can Improve Your Resume to Land Your Dream Job&amp;via=infeeds" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="icon ic-tw"></span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="oflow"></div></div><div class="hidden footer-holder"><div class="footer"><a href="javascript:;" class="if-copyr">&copy; 2021 Infeeds</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/about?ref=footer">about</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/premium?ref=footer">premium</a> <!--<a href="https://infeeds.com/services/careers">careers</a>--> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/terms?ref=footer">terms</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/contact?ref=footer">contact</a> <a href="https://infeeds.com/services/help?ref=footer">help</a></div></div></body></html>
