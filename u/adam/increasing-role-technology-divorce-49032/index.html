<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has made its way into our lives, and now we cannot imagine how we could live without it before. Modern people use techs daily, everything, from smartphones and smartwatches, is an inherent part of our life today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since many don’t bother much about the effects it may have on their well-being, they are very likely to eventually run into many marital problems that may even lead to divorce. It has been already reported that the gadgets that surround us in our daily life are one of the main factors that play a role in couples ending their marital relationships on paper. Except for causing divorce, technology can also change the way it goes and, in some cases, still have some impact when it is complete. Below, there are some of the many ways technology can cause and impact your divorce.</span></p>
<p><b>Shared Accounts Prepare the Ground for Divorce</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many married people tend to share everything with their best halves. For most of us, it is normal if spouses have access to their partners’ email accounts, social media profiles, team calendars, Netflix accounts, and so forth. While there is nothing bad about sharing passwords with our better halves, enabling your partner to control all your interactions may carry some negative consequences. In marital relationships, where trust is an issue, allowing your partner to monitor what you watch online, who you text to, what purchases you make, and who you call to can prepare the ground for another conflict.</span></p>
<p><b>Increased Screen Time Triggers Divorce</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time when technology was not that advanced as it is today, people had more privacy and had fewer distractions to rant about. In the Age of Information, people face a myriad of distractions that may lead to a breakup. There is evidence indicating that the more we use social media, the higher the chances we have to come into conflict with our partners and, as a result, get divorced. It is worth mentioning that social media by themselves doesn’t carry any threat to our relationships; it is an increased social media use that can damage our couplehood a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It s reported that mobiles and online media have a tremendous bearing on the frequency of divorce. Of course, modern married couples still face the problems we have faced in days past, but with the appearance of mobiles, the Internet, and social media, these problems have been complicated and augmented on a large scale. Spouses spend less time together as they prefer to take every opportunity of checking their incoming messages, reading news feeds, commenting friends’ pictures, etc. People start to forget how it is like to spend time with their spouses talking about current issues, catching up with each other’s news, and simply relaxing – and all this without smartphones and online media.</span></p>
<p><b>Technology that Helps During and After Divorce</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are websites, like </span><a href="https://onlinedivorcer.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onlinedivorcer.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , that help divorcing couples go through the process without any troubles, there are apps that can help divorced people cooperate better; they help them co-parent and interact with each other after divorce more effectively. Let us say, there are shared techs that come with calendar features so that divorced parents can organize their visiting hours in one place. When things are coming to a crisis, the apps help users puzzle out what is happening and grab the bull by the horns in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eliminating negative effects of divorce, during and after it, gives you a great chance to move on easily. Of course, no </span><a href="http://onlinedivorcer.com/online-divorce-missouri"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best divorce service</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can help you make a clean sweep of all the negativity; all it can do is to help you de-stress yourself and get over a divorce and its consequences more easily, the same is with the “post-divorce” apps.</span></p>
<p><b>Technology Can Be Used As Evidence during Divorce</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, techs give more outlets for collecting information that can be used in court later on. Very often, divorce lawyers provide evidence from their clients’ partners’ social media profiles and use it to prove infidelity. Truth be told, 30% of all divorce cases mention the word “social media” at some stage. This is mainly because online media make it easy for the users to connect and communicate with others and thus are often believed to promote infidelity which can lead to a breakup sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also many dating websites. Not only they become the main reason for divorce, but also they serve as a great source of evidence of marital misconduct. The information found on these sites can greatly change the outcome of any case. Truth be told, evidence can be obtained from any online media. Email, social media, and even bank accounts may have records of your partner’s activities that can help matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to trace someone’s movements with an EZ-Pass or mobile. Many are surprised to learn that their devices keep track of their location. Those who use Google maps have information about their movements stored in the Google account. So, if your partner knows all your passwords, then he or she can get info about all your locations with ease. And this sort of evidence can count against you in court.</span></p>
